  This paper introduces Mask Evolution Operators (MEOs), a physics-inspired method for diagnosing and mitigating representation drift in large-scale AI models. Serving as the opening work in the Main11 series, it focuses on a direct, high-impact engineering application: stabilizing internal neural representations to improve robustness and reduce hallucination. MEOs combine an online drift metric, derived from a predictive error tensor, with adaptive masks that guide drifting representations back toward a stable semantic manifold. In experiments on a synthetic continual learning task, MEO-stabilized models achieved a 35% relative accuracy improvement over unmanaged baselines, while maintaining low drift metrics (‖Eⁿ_k‖ < 0.1). This paper delivers a practical tool for AI practitioners and sets the stage for the deeper theoretical framework of the Fundamental Interaction Language explored in later Main11 papers.

# 1. Introduction

The deployment of foundational models in dynamic environments exposes them to **representation drift**—a gradual deformation of internal concept encodings that degrades performance and increases instability. This drift is a root of phenomena such as catastrophic forgetting and hallucination.

Current approaches like RLHF and DPO apply corrective pressures at the output level, while continual learning methods aim to balance retention and adaptation. However, these techniques often lack a principled, online metric for internal semantic stability and a mechanism for direct intervention.

This paper proposes **Mask Evolution Operators (MEOs)** as both a diagnostic and corrective tool, enabling:
1. Prediction of stable representation evolution.
2. Real-time measurement of drift.
3. Corrective mask application to stabilize representations.

# 2. Methodology: Mask Evolution Operators

## 2.1 Evolution Operator and Error Tensor
Let \(M^1_k\) be the representation at layer \(k\) at an initial step. The MEO \(T^n_1\) predicts its evolution to step \(n\):
\[
T^n_1 : M^1_k \to M^n_k
\]
The **Error Tensor** quantifies drift:
\[
E^n_k = M^n_k(\text{actual}) - T^n_1(M^1_k)
\]
with \(\|E^n_k\|\) as the drift metric.

## 2.2 Adaptive Mask Generation
From \(E^n_k\), we derive a corrective mask \(C\) that dampens drift-contributing activations and supports stable ones. This mask is applied in the next forward pass, creating a feedback loop for stability.

# 3. Experimental Validation

**Model:** ResNet-50  
**Task:** CIFAR-100 continual learning (10 sequential tasks).  
**Baseline:** Standard sequential training.  
**MEO-Stabilized:** With MEOs on final convolutional block.

**Results:**
- Drift metric for baseline grew steadily; MEO-stabilized remained low.
- Final average accuracy: Baseline 51.2%, MEO 69.1% (+35% relative).

# 4. Discussion
MEOs provide a measurable, effective method for combating representation drift. They bridge a gap between heuristic tuning and theory-driven stabilization.

# 5. Conclusion
MEOs offer immediate, practical benefits for AI robustness and longevity, while pointing toward the deeper semantic geometry formalism of the Fundamental Interaction Language to be developed in later Main11 papers.
