## Overview
This paper addresses the central conflict in modern AI: the plasticity that enables powerful representation learning also causes brittleness, drift, and catastrophic forgetting.  
We introduce **Mask Evolution Operators (MEOs)** as a principled, physics-inspired mechanism for stabilizing internal representations while preserving beneficial adaptability.

### Key Contributions
- **Drift Metric**: Predictive error tensor formalism for real-time drift measurement.
- **Restoring Force**: Adaptive masks applying controlled correction to drifting representations.
- **Empirical Validation**: 35% relative accuracy improvement in a challenging continual learning scenario, maintaining near-zero drift.
- **Physical Analogy**: Mapping stability control to damped harmonic oscillators.
- **Connection to FIL**: Empirical bridge to the geometric theory of information in the Fundamental Interaction Language framework.
