Fine‑Granularity Computation: Walk Notes – 11 July 2025

These notes consolidate our discussion during (and immediately after) your Friday‑morning walk.  The focus is the physical and mathematical structure of the smallest possible computational act and its relationship to tick (clock) time.

1 Computational Expressiveness per Operation

Term of art we settled on: computational expressiveness per operation – the amount of semantic transformation achievable per fundamental energy‑costed act of computation.

Given the Landauer–Bremermann limits (re‑derived in earlier chapters):



we framed a Computational Expressiveness Bound:



where  encodes the device‑specific semantic degrees of freedom (classical bit‑flip ⇒ ; ‑qubit gate ⇒ , etc.).

Definition:  is a single physically distinguishable bit transition: .

Energy floor: .

Time floor:  (Bremermann‑saturated).

All higher operations (inner products, Transformer attention, FIL kernels) are compositions of many  events.

We parametrize the one‑bit horizon by temperature:



3.1 Gradient



Tick time shrinks as .  Cooling is quadratically expensive in time.

3.2 Metric & Curvature

Induced line element: .  Curvature diverges as  (no finite‑time bit flip at absolute zero).

3.3 Capacity Vector Field



Divergence w.r.t.  is constant → linear capacity gain per kelvin.

Curl vanishes → there exists a scalar potential; no closed "free‑lunch" loops.



Runtime stretches inversely with temperature; higher‑level algorithms inherit this scaling.

4 Why This Matters

Device comparison (GPU vs. quantum): same energy and tick budget, radically different  → different semantic workload per tick.

Architectural goal: maximise expressiveness  while respecting .

Research agenda: compute gradients/curls of higher‑order semantic fields pulled back to ; design hardware (e.g. InterferoShell) that tiles  most efficiently.
