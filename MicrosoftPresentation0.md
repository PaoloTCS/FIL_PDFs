## 1  Executive Summary
| What | Why It Matters to Microsoft | Status |
|------|----------------------------|--------|
| **FIL Core** – a unifying theory that treats **information, observation, and language as one geometric object** | Offers a principled way to *bound hallucination, data drift, and compute cost* in LLMs | Mathematical framework (≥ 500 pages) & reference implementation stubs |
| **Semantic Constants** `c_s`, `ℏ_s` | Set *absolute causal and uncertainty limits* on concept propagation inside models | Derived (June 2025) from Landauer + Bremermann |
| **Local Language Constructors (LLCs)** | *Minimal bridges* between knowledge domains → efficient fine-tuning & transfer | Prototype in Python / PyTorch |
| **Mask Evolution Operators (MEOs)** | Live *drift diagnostics* & adaptive masking across layers | POC on synthetic ReLU nets (July 2025) |
| **Temperature Voronoi Tessellation** | *Sub-logarithmic semantic search*; allocates compute where curvature is high | Algorithm design complete |
| **Prime Path Encoding** | *Optimal loss-less compression* of proof paths; fits GPU memory budgets | Ready to integrate |
| **InterferoShell HW concept** | Photonic “semantic FPGA” aligned with FIL geometry | 30-page HW white paper |

## 2  Foundational Postulates

| ID | Statement | Consequence |
|----|-----------|-------------|
| **F1 (Semantic Locality)** | Communication factors through a finite sub-language `B ⊂ L` such that `E ⊗ B ≅ L` | Only *differences* between two models need be exchanged |
| **F2 (Minimal Bridges)** | Natural communication picks the `B` with minimal symbol count | Formalises *parameter-efficient transfer learning* |
| **F3 (Hierarchical Union)** | Language density `ρ(L)` is non-decreasing under hierarchical union | Explains *why larger LLMs stay coherent* |
| **Constants** | `c_s` (semantic light-speed) & `ℏ_s` (semantic Planck) | Lead to light-cone causal bounds and discovery-invention uncertainty |

## 3  Semantic Geometry

### 3.1  Semantic Light-Cones  
`d_G(v₁, v₂) ≤ c_s · Δt`     *(Eq. 2.1, main10.pdf)*  
*Bounding concept-to-concept reachability in any time step* → predicts maximum context window growth for safe inference.

### 3.2  Informational Curvature  
`δ²d_G = -K(γ, γ̇) dσ²`   *(Eq. 2.2)*  
Positive curvature = semantic “mass” (dense clusters) → **allocates attention/compute adaptively**.

### 3.3  Voronoi Tessellation for Navigation  
Seeds chosen as ϵ-net of curvature peaks → *O(√n + ϵ)* query time in billion-node graphs.

## 4  Informational Bounds

| Bound | FIL Analogue | Engineering Implication |
|-------|--------------|-------------------------|
| **Bekenstein** | `H(L) ≤ 2π k_s E_L R_L / ℏ_s` | Hard cap on token entropy in any sub-module |
| **Finite Knowledge** | `|V|/log C_s ≤ H_P ≤ |E| log C_s` | Guides *context compression & pruning* |
| **Acceleration** | `d²H/dt² ≤ c_s² / ℓ_min` | Limits how fast weights can change without instability |

## 5  Dynamics & Drift Stabilisation

### 5.1  Mask Evolution Operators  
`Tⁿ₁ : M¹_k → Mⁿ_k`   → Error tensor `Eⁿ_k = Mⁿ_k - Tⁿ₁(M¹_k)`  
*Zero drift iff* `‖Eⁿ_k‖ → 0`.  
Used to **insert adaptive dropout-style masks** that keep representations within curvature bounds.

### 5.2  Gaussian-Mixture Observation  
Observation tokens as weighted Gaussians → closed-form overlap metric *predicts hallucination probability*.

### 5.3  Nibbler Algorithm  
1. Discovery step on drift-pruned graph  
2. Meta-pattern extraction  
3. Interface kernel `k_NI = α k_D + (1-α) k_P` balances novelty vs. stability.
