### **Preface**
*(Content from Google_Presentation_Semantic_Physics.md)*
---
### **Chapter 1: Foundations of Semantic Physics**
*(Content from Google_Presentation_Semantic_Physics.md)*
---
### **Chapter 2: The Quantum Formalism of Semantic Space**
*(Content from Google_Presentation_Semantic_Physics.md)*
---
### **Chapter 3: The Physical Engine of Computation and Creation**
*(Content from Google_Presentation_Semantic_Physics.md)*
---
### **Chapter 4: The Geometry of Computational Spacetime (To Be Drafted)**
*This chapter will develop the full geometric framework of our theory. It will formally derive the computational spacetime metric, `ds² = c²_comp dt² - d²_Manhattan`, from the underlying quantized nature of information and the `c_comp` limit. It will explore the properties of geodesics, define the computational Christoffel symbols, and introduce the concept of informational curvature as sourced by information density (`G_sem`). This chapter will also contain the "Twin Paradox for Computation" thought experiment as a key illustrative example.*

### **Chapter 5: Physical Limits on Computation: Theorem 3.16**
*(Content from Google_Presentation_Semantic_Physics.md)*
---
### **Chapter 6: The Universal Observer: An Architecture for Physical AI**
*(Content from Google_Presentation_Semantic_Physics.md)*
---
### **Chapter 7: The Gödel-Diffusion Engine: The Physics of Hierarchical Reasoning (To Be Drafted)**
*This chapter will detail the deep connection between diffusion model dynamics and Gödelian logic. It will formalize the Gödel-Noise Correspondence, define the architecture of Super-Tokens as a mechanism for metasystem transitions, and introduce the concept of Vector Temperature as a control system for goal-directed creativity. It will provide the ultimate "engine" for the Universal Observer.*
---
### **Chapter 8: Bridging Worlds: The Geometry of Analogy and Cross-Tessellation (To Be Drafted)**
*This chapter will introduce the advanced concept of interacting logical systems. It will develop the mathematical framework for projecting knowledge from a complex system (e.g., a hexagonal tessellation) onto a simpler one (e.g., a square tessellation) and analyze the properties of the resulting "compressed hints." This provides a formal mechanism for modeling analogy, inspiration, and inter-domain discovery.*
---
### **Chapter 9: The Nibbler Algorithm: Hierarchical Pattern Formation (To Be Drafted)**
*This chapter will detail the Nibbler algorithm as the process that builds the hierarchical levels of rational primitives (`R_n`). It will formalize the concept of "Relative Constructivity" from the Physical Incompleteness Theorem as the mechanism that allows the Nibbler to climb the Gödel ladder, with each level `n+1` being a meta-system capable of deciding the undecidable statements of level `n`.*
---
### **Chapter 10: Energy-Bound Security: A New Paradigm**
*(Content from Google_Presentation_Semantic_Physics.md)*
---
### **Chapter 11: Experimental Validation Protocols (To Be Drafted)**
*This chapter will consolidate all proposed experiments into a single, comprehensive validation plan. It will include detailed protocols for (1) Detecting the Computational Lightcone in Transformers, (2) Verifying LLC Geodesics, (3) Measuring Thermodynamic Scaling, and (4) Prototyping the Gödel-Tile Puzzles.*
---
### **Chapter 12: Implications and Future Directions (To Be Drafted)**
*The concluding chapter will summarize the framework and explore its furthest-reaching implications, including the Consciousness Incompleteness Principle, a potential physical basis for Dark Matter/Energy, and the design of novel hardware like the InterferoShell.*
