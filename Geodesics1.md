1  Black-hole horizons as null information surfaces

In ordinary spacetime, the event-horizon is defined by the condition ds^{2}=0; light (the fastest permissible signal) skims that surface, separating causal interior from exterior.
In our computational-spacetime metric

ds^{2}=c_{\text{comp}}^{2}\,dt^{2}\;-\;d_{\text{Manhattan}}^{2},

the analogue of “light speed” is the maximal irreversible bit-rate c_{\text{comp}}.
Setting ds^{2}=0 therefore yields an information horizon: a locus where the cheapest possible computation just keeps up with the distance through semantic space. On one side, concepts can still influence each other via step-wise deduction (causal); on the other side, inference would require invention—jumps that out-run available energy/time budgets (acausal relative to the graph’s logic).

2  Geodesics as optimal knowledge paths

A geodesic in this metric minimizes

L=\!\int\!\sqrt{c_{\text{comp}}^{2}\bigl(\tfrac{dt}{d\tau}\bigr)^{2}-\bigl\| \tfrac{dx}{d\tau}\bigr\|_{1}^{2}}\;d\tau,

giving the Euler-Lagrange equation

\frac{d^{2}x^{\mu}}{d\tau^{2}}+\Gamma^{\mu}_{\nu\rho}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau}\frac{dx^{\rho}}{d\tau}=0.

When we treat the directed knowledge graph G=(V,E,\omega) as a discretized slice of that manifold, the continuous geodesic becomes a shortest-action path where edge weights play the role of local metric coefficients.
Key intuition:
	•	Timelike (discoverable) edges: weights/energy small enough that cumulative cost keeps ds^{2}>0.
	•	Spacelike (inventive) edges: too big—pushing the path outside the causal cone.
	•	Null edges: critical weights that ride the horizon, making the path exactly marginal.

3  Equality condition on the horizon

Your phrase “an equality of some type of information system” can be formalized as

\bigl(\text{cumulative energy spent on computation}\bigr)
=\bigl(\text{minimum energy required by Landauer–Bremermann to traverse those edges}\bigr).

At that equality:
	•	❯ Inside the horizon*: you can still follow directed edges step by step (logical discovery).
	•	❯ On the horizon*: each additional edge sits right at the physical limit—an information ‘light ray’.
	•	❯ Outside*: you’d need extra-physical shortcuts (semantic tunnelling, invention, or higher-temperature search).

⸻

4  A practical mapping recipe
	1.	Assign energies to graph edges via their Landauer cost E_{e}=k_{B}T\ln2.
	2.	Convert those energies to “distances” d_{e}=E_{e}/c_{\text{comp}}.
	3.	Compute shortest-action paths; classify them by sign of the resulting ds^{2}.
	4.	Identify the null surface: paths where action =0. This is the graph’s event horizon.

⸻

5  Questions to refine together
	•	• Which graph slice are you most interested in? (FIL discovery layer, Nibbler levels, temperature-Voronoi cells, …)
	•	• Do we hold T fixed, or let semantic temperature vary along the path—making the horizon a warped surface?
	•	• Shall we test the idea numerically on a toy sub-graph (say, 1000 nodes with synthetic weights) to visualise the horizon?

Let me know where you’d like to dive first, and we’ll shape the geodesic discussion from there.

Q: So what is the relationship between orthogonality and passing the horizon? In particular, orthogonality of dimensions. So dimensions of dimensions and stuff like that. Through some kind of a cascading mechanism, are all relative orthogonalities, in other words, not real orthogonalities, collapse, and then their parent dimension and its orthogonality, the parents also, collapse. So basically, all the dimensions and their orthogonalities collapse to a single point. 

A: Simple notes – orthogonality as you drift toward the information horizon

Stage	What “orthogonality” means here	Metric picture	Directed-graph picture	Net effect
1 . Far outside the horizon	Distinct dimensions ( x¹, x², … ) have true inner-product ⟨eᵢ,eⱼ⟩ = 0.  Independence = zero semantic cross-talk.	The computational-spacetime metric g_{\mu\nu} is non-degenerate; basis vectors are spacelike and clearly orthogonal.	Edges split cleanly into disjoint “channels”; you can reason along one path without paying cost on others.	High-rank space, many independent inference routes.
2 . Approaching the horizon	The red-shift factor shrinks timelike component g_{tt} while spacelike coeffs blow up.  Inner products are rescaled by g_{\mu\nu}.	The norm of each basis vector diverges or vanishes, so the angle between them becomes ill-defined.	Edge weights inflate differently; formerly cheap lateral hops grow expensive → paths tilt toward the least-cost (radial) direction.	Relative orthogonality erodes first; dimensions become “slanted” toward the same null generator.
3 . At the horizon (null surface)	Metric determinant → 0.  All non-radial directions collapse onto a single null direction; ⟨eᵢ,eⱼ⟩ ≈ 0 but also ⟨eᵢ,eᵢ⟩ ≈ 0.	Only one independent light-like direction survives; everything else is gauge redundancy.	Every path with finite cost is forced onto the single marginal trajectory (“information light-ray”).  Distinct channels merge.	Effective dimension = 1.  Orthogonality has cascaded into total degeneracy.
4 . Inside (beyond causal reach)	The former basis vectors now all point “outside” the allowed cone. Orthogonality is meaningless—no causal transport.	No timelike separation ↔ no computation in finite time.	No finite-energy edges reach here unless you re-invent information (non-causal jump).	Graph terminates; interior is computationally blank.

Key take-aways
	1.	Orthogonality is metric-dependent. As the metric degenerates at ds^{2}=0, the inner product that defined independence also collapses.
	2.	Cascading collapse: fine-grained (child) dimensions lose independence first; their parent axes follow, until all are squeezed into the null generator.
	3.	Holographic angle: the horizon effectively projects the bulk’s high-D semantics onto a 1-D light-sheet—mirroring how black-hole horizons encode 3-D volume data on a 2-D surface.
	4.	Graph intuition: rising edge costs funnel every feasible walk into a single minimal-action class; orthogonal channels are indistinguishable at the limit.

Next-step prompts
	•	Should we formalise this with a concrete cost function on one of your existing FIL sub-graphs?
	•	Do we let “semantic temperature” vary so the collapse happens on a warped (non-spherical) horizon?
	•	Would a numerical toy (100 nodes) help visualise the loss of rank as we tune a red-shift parameter?

Let me know which thread you’d like to tug on when you’re back.

(continuation after answering questions above): Below is a compact (but explicit) formalization you can drop straight into a working notebook or LaTeX file.  It captures (1) a concrete edge-cost/metric that drives the geodesic computation and (2) a spatially varying semantic-temperature field that produces the “red-shift” needed for orthogonality collapse at the horizon.

1 Graph, state variables, and notation

Symbol	Meaning	Typical units
G=(V,E)	Directed knowledge graph	—
b_{e}	Information payload on edge e (bits that must be moved/erased)	bits
T(v)	Semantic temperature at node v	kelvin-equivalent (can be dimensionless if rescaled)
\kappa	Boltzmann factor k_{B}\ln 2 (≈ 9.57\times10^{-24}\,\text{J K}^{-1})	J K^{-1}
c_{\text{comp}}	“Speed of causality” in computation‐space (bits · J^{-1} · s^{-1})	—
E_{e}	Landauer–Bremermann cost to traverse e	joule
d_{e}	Effective distance assigned to e	(bit-seconds)


⸻

2 Concrete edge cost
	1.	Landauer energy
E_{e}\;=\;\kappa\,T\!\bigl(\text{tail}(e)\bigr)\;b_{e}.
	2.	Convert to distance by dividing by the computational “light-speed”
d_{e}\;=\;\frac{E_{e}}{c_{\text{comp}}} \;=\;\frac{\kappa\,T(\text{tail}(e))}{c_{\text{comp}}}\;b_{e}.

Interpretation: higher local temperature makes erasure cheaper (distance shrinks); colder regions stretch distances—exactly the “red-shift” you requested.

⸻

3 Metric and horizon condition

Treat G as a discretized manifold with line element

ds^{2}\;=\;c_{\text{comp}}^{2}\,\alpha^{2}(v)\,dt^{2}\;-\;\!\sum_{e\,\text{out}(v)}\!\beta^{2}{e}(v)\,dx{e}^{2},

where
	•	\alpha(v) controls the timelike coefficient and is inversely proportional to temperature
\alpha(v)\;=\;\frac{T_{0}}{T(v)},
with T_{0} a reference temperature.
	•	\beta_{e}(v) is proportional to d_{e}
\beta_{e}(v)\;=\;\frac{d_{e}}{\Delta x_{e}}\quad (\Delta x_{e}=1\text{ hop}).

Horizon (null surface)

Set ds^{2}=0:

c_{\text{comp}}^{2}\,\alpha^{2}(v)\,\Delta t^{2} \;=\; \sum_{e\in \text{path}} d_{e}^{2}.

Any path that exactly saturates this equality rides the horizon.  Because T(v) appears in both \alpha and each d_{e}, spatial variation in semantic temperature warps the horizon non-uniformly.

⸻

4 Orthogonality cascade

The Gram matrix of basis directions at a node is

g_{ij}(v)\;=\;\text{diag}\!\bigl(c_{\text{comp}}^{2}\alpha^{2}(v), -\beta_{1}^{2}(v), -\beta_{2}^{2}(v),\dots\bigr).
	•	As T(v)\to 0 (colder → distance long):
	•	\alpha(v)\to\infty – time component inflates
	•	Each \beta_{e}(v)\to\infty – spatial norms inflate faster
	•	The determinant
\det g(v)\;\propto\;\alpha^{2}(v)\prod_{e}\!(-\beta_{e}^{2}(v))
crosses zero when the ratio \alpha/\beta_{e} reaches a critical value; then all eigenvectors co-lineate with the null generator.  Every apparent orthogonality collapses to a single direction.

⸻

5 Implementation recipe
	1.	Choose a temperature field
Analytic toy: T(v)=T_{0}\bigl(1-\lambda\,r(v)\bigr) with radial coordinate r and slope \lambda.  \lambda\uparrow sharpens the collapse.
	2.	Compute edge distances d_{e} with the formula above.
	3.	Run Dijkstra / A-star / Bellman-Ford to find minimal-action paths.
	4.	Classify paths by comparing total action to the time available c_{\text{comp}}\Delta t.
	5.	Locate horizon nodes where the minimal action equals the null bound, or track where \det g=0.

(When you’re ready for the numerical toy, we just discretize the radial coordinate, sample T(v), and plot how the rank of g_{ij}(v) drops as you dial \lambda.)

⸻

Quick checkpoints for you
	•	Units OK? We’ve kept k_{B}\ln2 explicit so you can swap in dimensionless bits if preferred.
	•	Temperature field source?  Internal “semantic entropy” estimator or an external schedule?
	•	Edge payload b_{e}: real bit-counts from your Nibbler compressor or a uniform test value?

Let me know any tweaks, and I’ll have the toy experiment ready in the follow-up prompt.

Q: So we have a family of dimensions and a corresponding geodesic. Let's now say we have families of dimensions and their corresponding geodesics. First question naturally arises, what is there in common? What is the intersection? What characteristics of a dimension uniquely characterize a geodesic? The implication might be for our case here, what are impossible paths? What are paths in a graph that will never lead to another node? So the singularity, let's call it singularity for now, the singularity of a dimensions and geodesics object might compromise any solution to another pair. But maybe using Cantor's omegas, we can find for any family of objects, which are right now what I'm talking about, the objects right now are dimensions and they're geodesics. So we have, let's say, n of them. Then we recurse and go higher and we have families of families of objects and geodesics. This sounds very similar to Gödel's omegas and our work in this field. Just for thoughts.

A: Sketch-notes — from one dimension → a family of dimensions → families-of-families

Objects
\mathcal{D}i = a dimension equipped with its own local metric g_i.
\Gamma_i = \{\gamma{i,\alpha}\} = the bundle of geodesics generated by that metric.
A family is the pair F_i=(\mathcal{D}_i,\Gamma_i).

⸻

1 What invariants carve out a geodesic for a given dimension?

Candidate invariant	Continuous manifold view	Graph/discrete analogue
Signature of g_i	Timelike vs. spacelike directions fix which curves can be null ⇒ selects the causal cone	Sign( edge-cost matrix ) ⇒ admissible vs. forbidden hops
Symmetry group \mathrm{Iso}(g_i)	Killing fields ⇒ conserved quantities ⇒ restrict admissible geodesics	Automorphisms that keep all edge weights; geodesic = shortest path modulo those symmetries
Curvature scalars R_i	Bounds conjugate-point distance ⇒ sets focal/singular zones	Graph Ricci-curvature (Ollivier, Forman) tells where all walks bunch
Topological class \pi_k(\mathcal{D}_i)	Certain homotopy classes cannot host any geodesic that stays causal	Strongly connected components vs. sinks/sources

A geodesic is uniquely “typed” by the intersection of these invariants:
\text{ID}(\gamma)=
\bigl(\mathrm{signature},\,\mathrm{symmetry},\,R,\,\text{topology}\bigr).

⸻

2 Intersections between families F_i and F_j

Define
\mathrm{Int}(F_i,F_j)=\{\,\gamma\;|\;\gamma\in\Gamma_i\cap\Gamma_j\,\}.

When is this non-empty?

	1.	Metric compatibility – g_i and g_j must be conformal on the sub-region swept out by \gamma.
	2.	Invariant overlap – the conserved quantities (energy, angular momentum, …) must coincide.
	3.	Topological allowance – \pi_1-classes must match; otherwise any path deformable in D_i may be obstructed in D_j.

Graph picture: two weighted digraphs share a geodesic iff there exists a walk whose cumulative cost attains the minima under both weight functions. That happens precisely on the edge set where the two weight tables are scalar multiples of one another.

⸻

3 Impossible paths (“no-go” zones)

A path is impossible for every family in a collection \{F_i\}_{i<\kappa} if one of these holds:

Cause	Continuous phrasing	Graph phrasing
Energy divergence	\int_\gamma \sqrt{g_{tt}}\,dt\to\infty	Total cost \sum d_e = \infty
Curvature barrier	Focal point before target: geodesic self-intersects ⇒ cannot extend	Edge weights blow up near a hub; all shortest paths detour away
Signature flip	Path would have to cross a region where g changes sign ⇒ metric degeneracy	Edge changes from causal (positive weight) to acausal (negative/undefined)
Topological obstruction	Needed homotopy class missing (e.g., no handle)	Source & sink lie in different SCCs

Those “no-go” sets are your singularities.

⸻

4 Cantor ω-tower and recursive refinement

Let
\mathscr{F}^{(0)} = \{F_i\}_{i<n}.

Produce higher strata by ordinal recursion:
	1.	Successor step \alpha \mapsto \alpha+1:
\mathscr{F}^{(\alpha+1)} =
\Bigl\{\,\bigl(\mathrm{Int}(F,G),\;\text{geodesics within}\bigr)
: F\in \mathscr{F}^{(\alpha)},\,G\in\mathscr{F}^{(\alpha)}\Bigr\}.
Each step intersects everything with everything, winnowing invariants.
	2.	Limit stage \lambda\;(\text{limit ordinal}):
\mathscr{F}^{(\lambda)}=\bigcap_{\alpha<\lambda}\mathscr{F}^{(\alpha)}.

Analogy to Gödel’s ω-sequence: at each successor level you embed the previous theory inside a strictly stronger theory that “sees” more impossibilities (new singularities). The fixed point where no new intersections appear is like a closure ordinal for this dimension-geodesic lattice.

⸻

5 Why this matters for FIL / Nibbler
	•	Uniqueness filters – In Nibbler compression a path label that survives to a high-ordinal stratum is canonical: any other dimension-system must agree on its cost.
	•	Dead-end detection – Impossible paths correspond to proofs that certain semantic claims can never be reached by deduction alone → flag them for invention (your “acausal” operations).
	•	Singularity handling – Dimensions whose invariants collapse mark hubs where orthogonality vanishes; they act as semantic attractors. Routing everything through them risks information loss, so they deserve explicit entropy budgeting.

⸻

Quick prompts for the next step
	•	Pick concrete invariants. Which few should we track first (signature + symmetry group + graph Ricci)?
	•	Ordinal cut-off. Up to which ω-power do you want to iterate before declaring convergence in practice?
	•	Implementation. Shall I prototype a small Python routine that, given k weighted digraphs, builds the ω-tower of intersection graphs and lists “never-reachable” nodes at each level?

Let me know where you’d like to zoom in, and we’ll start coding or formal proof sketches accordingly.

Q: What would the geodesics be of parallel computation? And let's relate that also to orthogonality. So if everything in the parallel computation isn't totally independent in other totally different dimensions, how could we use orthogonality? And then what are the repercussions for the geodesics of the computation as a whole?

A: 1  Set-up – a “computation manifold” for p concurrent threads

Think of the global execution state as a point in

\mathcal{C} \;=\;\bigl[0,1\bigr]^{p},

where coordinate x^{i}\in[0,1] measures the normalised progress of thread i from start (0) to finish (1).
A metric g_{ij}(x) encodes how much incremental cost (time, energy, memory-bandwidth…) you pay when the two threads advance simultaneously:
	•	Perfect independence ⇒ g_{ij}=\delta_{ij}\,w_{i}(x^{i}) (diagonal).
	•	Resource coupling / synchronisation ⇒ off-diagonal terms g_{ij}\neq 0.

⸻

2  Geodesic = globally optimal schedule

A path \gamma(\tau)\subset\mathcal{C} is a schedule: it tells how every thread progresses as wall-time \tau moves forward.
The action

L[\gamma]=\int\!\sqrt{g_{ij}\,\frac{dx^{i}}{d\tau}\,\frac{dx^{j}}{d\tau}}\;d\tau

penalises wall-time and contention.

Geodesic = schedule with stationary action ⇒ Euler–Lagrange
\frac{d^{2}x^{k}}{d\tau^{2}}
+\Gamma^{k}_{ij}\,\frac{dx^{i}}{d\tau}\,\frac{dx^{j}}{d\tau}=0.

Exactly the same machinery we used for information horizons, but now the “spacetime” is resource–progress space.

⸻

3  Role of orthogonality

Scenario	Metric form	Meaning	Consequence for geodesic
Fully orthogonal threads	g_{ij}=w_i\,\delta_{ij}	Each thread’s progress incurs cost only in its own dimension.	Geodesic separates: x^{i}(\tau) evolve independently ⇒ any schedule that minimises each $begin:math:text$w_i\!\int\!
Weak coupling (shared cache, soft barriers)	g_{ij}=w_i\delta_{ij}+ \epsilon h_{ij} with \epsilon\ll1	Almost orthogonal dimensions; coupling is a small perturbation.	Geodesic deviates slightly: threads drift to spread contention over time (analogue of lensing by mild curvature).
Strong coupling / synchronisation	large off-diagonals	Progress of one thread drags others; independence lost.	Geodesic collapses onto critical-path style execution: long stretches where only tightly coupled group advances; other coordinates freeze.  Orthogonality has “collapsed” like our horizon story.

Interpretation:
Orthogonality is valuable because it keeps g_{ij} diagonal, allowing parallel speed-up to factorise.  As soon as cross-terms grow, the manifold’s curvature bends the geodesic toward serial or partially-serial regions—the effective dimensionality of progress space drops.

⸻

4  Detecting impossible (non-reachable) schedules

Just as spacelike paths were forbidden past an information horizon, here a schedule is impossible if the integral cost blows up:

\int\sqrt{g_{ij}\,\dot x^{i}\dot x^{j}}\;d\tau = \infty.

Typical causes:
	•	Mutual exclusion → metric diverges when two protected sections overlap.
	•	Hard barrier → g_{ij}\to\infty unless x^{1}=\cdots=x^{m} at the barrier time.
	•	Bandwidth saturation → off-diagonals become large once combined throughput exceeds HW limit.

Those singular zones behave exactly like curvature singularities in our earlier discussion.

⸻

5  Practical uses
	1.	Schedule synthesis: treat g_{ij} built from profiling data, solve geodesic ODE (or discrete Dijkstra on time-expanded graph) to get the fastest feasible parallel schedule.
	2.	Orthogonality budgeting: design data layout / locking so that the metric stays as diagonal as possible—maximising available geodesic “corridors”.
	3.	Geodesic curvature ≈ contention indicator: high curvature regions flag parts of code where small timing jitters cause big slow-downs; they deserve refactoring.

⸻

6  Link back to previous frameworks

Earlier notion	Parallel-computation analogue
Information horizon	Hardware/resource limit where g_{ij} diverges (e.g., memory wall)
Orthogonality collapse	Threads forced into serial critical path
Cantor ω-tower	Hierarchy of schedule families: basic thread pairs → groups → groups-of-groups; intersecting their admissible geodesics iteratively prunes dead schedules.


⸻

Next moves (when you’re ready)
	•	Define a concrete g_{ij} for, say, a GPU kernel launch sharing L2 cache.
	•	Numerical toy: two-thread model with mutex to visualise how geodesic bends as lock-hold time varies.
	•	Extend ω-tower: iterate intersections of schedule families to highlight truly impossible parallelisations.
