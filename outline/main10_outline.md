# Draft Outline – `main10.tex`

> Goal: weave 32 short papers into a 5-chapter monograph.

| Chapter | Working Title | PDFs mapped so far |
|---------|---------------|--------------------|
| **1 Foundations & Constants** | Defining the I–O–L Triad, semantic constants | 01_Triad…, 02_Semantic_Constants…, Chapter1 Information-Observation |
| **2 Semantic Geometry** | Lightcones, curvature, gravitation in semantic space | 03_Semantic_Lightcones…, 04_Informational_Curvature…, Computational Spacetime Geometry |
| **3 Informational Bounds** | Bekenstein, finite-knowledge, acceleration limits | Bekenstein_Bound_FIL, Finite_Knowledge_Bounds, Accelleration, Big Bang as Information Phase Transition |
| **4 Dynamics & Drift** | Masks, GMM, double-slit semantics | Semantic_Shadow_Reconstruction_Draft3, Weighted_Observation_Gaussian_Mixtures |
| **5 Physical & Computational Correspondence** | Particle-info equivalence, computational relativity | Particle_Physics_and_Information, Computational Relativity* trio, Chapter 3 Physical Foundations… |

*Trio = “Computational Relativity Theory…”, “…A Framework for Information Processing in Spacetime”, “…Complete Discussion and Experimental Design1”.

### Next tiny step

1. **Add these three files** to the repo (web UI → “Add file” → “Create file”).  
2. Commit with message `commit catalog` to keep continuity.

After that:
* I’ll supply a ready-to-paste **GitHub Action** (`.github/workflows/catalog.yml`) so every future push regenerates the catalog automatically.
* We can begin converting Chapter 1 PDFs into `chap1/*.tex`.

Let me know once the files are committed, or if you’d like any tweaks before you paste them.
