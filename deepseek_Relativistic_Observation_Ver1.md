## 1. Executive Summary  
We explore the hypothesis that **probability updates can act as information carriers** beyond classical Bayesian inference, mediated by a *Semantic Observation Algebra (SOA)*. Key ideas:  
- **Observer-dependent knowledge synchronization** without explicit communication.  
- **Relativity-like constraints** emerging from SOA’s thermodynamic budgets ($B(T,\tau)$) and non-commutative observation operators ($\hat{\mathcal{O}}$).  
- **Star-explosion thought experiment** as a testbed for SOA’s physical realism.

## 2. Core Concepts  

### 2.1 Semantic Observation Algebra (SOA)  
From [your SOA draft](#), SOA formalizes observation as:  
```math
\hat{\mathcal{O}}[w,\mathsf{m}] := \mathsf{m}\,\Big(\sum_{M\in\mathcal{M}} w(M)\,\hat{M}\Big)\,\mathsf{m}^\dagger
