Below is a first-pass scaffold for a general-physics analogue of Feynman diagrams—what we’ll temporarily call Pignatelli Diagrams (PDs). I step through the four things you asked for:

Level ℓ	Object class 𝒪ℓ ( “nodes” )	Canonical examples	Why it’s fundamental / concatenation order rationale
0 (constants)	Scalar invariants 𝑐 (ℝ‐valued)	c, ℏ, k<sub>B</sub>, coupling constants	Set numerical scale for every other quantity
1 (spacetime)	Manifolds/regions 𝑀	Minkowski patch, curved chart	Stage on which all dynamical DOFs live
2 (fields)	Sections ϕ ∶ 𝑀 → 𝔽	Dirac spinor, SU(3) gauge field	Carrier of local DOFs; excitations become particles
3 (particles)	Localised excitations	e⁻, p⁺, γ, phonon	What experiments “see”—already degree-2 (needs 𝑀 & ϕ)
4 (observables)	Self-adjoint ops Ô	momentum, charge, entropy	Tie theory to measurement/LLC validation ℒ<sub>FIL</sub> main9 (5)
5 (symmetries)	Group elements g ∈ 𝒢	Lorentz boost, gauge rotation	Generate conserved currents, constrain vertices
6 (processes)	Histories / paths ℋ	e⁻e⁺→γγ, β-decay	Sequences of interactions; what Feynman graphs encode
7 (laws)	Maps between path-spaces	QED vertex rule, Einstein eqn.	Relations-of-relations (degree ≥ 2) governing all others

1 . Objects vs. relations
Objects 𝒪ℓ are graded: each ℓ>0 already needs lower-level data, so relations appear one level after the things they relate.

Relations ℛ(𝒪ℓ,𝒪m) live in a relation matrix ℛ whose (ℓ,m) entry is the set of allowed morphisms 𝒪ℓ → 𝒪m (see table below).

2 . The relation–relation matrix ℛ
Colour-coding cells (here shown textually) highlights arity / “rank”:

𝒪₀	𝒪₁	𝒪₂	𝒪₃	𝒪₄	𝒪₅	𝒪₆	𝒪₇
𝒪₀ const	id	set-val	param	param	scale	—	—	—
𝒪₁ space	—	diffeo	support	world-line	frame	gauge-cov	background	—
𝒪₂ fields	—	—	auto	creation	operator algebra	charge rep	Lagrangian density	—
𝒪₃ parts	—	—	—	scattering amp	detector map	rep action	Feynman rule	—
𝒪₄ obs	—	—	—	—	commutation	symmetry gen	Ward id.	—
𝒪₅ symm	—	—	—	—	—	group law	equiv. class	—
𝒪₆ proc	—	—	—	—	—	—	composition	equation-of-motion
𝒪₇ laws	—	—	—	—	—	—	—	meta-consistency

Rank of a relation = minimum level shift it induces:
rank(𝜌) = m − ℓ. Interactions (𝒪₃→𝒪₃) have rank 0; symmetry actions (𝒪₅→𝒪₂) have rank -3, etc.

Relations-of-relations (cells on or below diagonal for ℓ≥6) automatically become 2-morphisms—they form the degree-2 objects you mentioned.

Ordering by (deg, loop order) reproduces usual perturbative hierarchies while remaining meaningful outside QFT.

read: a symmetry element g acts (double arrow) on field φ, then creates a particle e⁻.

Next steps
Refine object list for your preferred ontology (e.g., add “semantic wavefront” nodes from Temperature Voronoi work).

Populate ℛ programmatically—we can export to CSV or LaTeX for inspection.

Graphical grammar—choose glyphs & colours; we can prototype with TikZ or Graphviz.

Check consistency against FIL validation metric (eq. 1) and update Nibbler’s discovery/invention flows.
