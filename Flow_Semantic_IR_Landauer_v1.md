# Flow-Field Internal Representation for Language: Energy, Landauer, and Graph-to-Geometry Mapping
**Version:** v1.0 (draft for Paolo)  
**Scope:** Consolidates the current chat’s ideas and links them explicitly to themes in *Theoretical Work FIL* (Semantic Action, belief graphs, primes-of-primes, ELP, precomputed wavefronts, cardinality cascade, etc.).

---

## 0. Executive Summary

We propose an **internal representation (IR)** that sits between two LLM stages. The IR is a **high-dimensional flow field** evolving on a manifold \(M^d\), sculpted by a potential \(\Phi\) derived from a **directed knowledge graph**. The dynamics are Fokker–Planck/Langevin-like, so “noising” and “denoising” are **physical diffusion** rather than simulated CUDA loops. The **read-out** is a set of physically measurable observables (e.g., local density, gradient, vorticity), linearly mapped back to symbols for the downstream LLM. This makes the IR an **analog reservoir computer** whose energy use can, in principle, approach the **Landauer limit**.

We formalize (i) the graph→geometry mapping, (ii) the high‑D flow equations, (iii) observables/read‑out, and (iv) **energy bookkeeping** with Landauer/Jarzynski/Crooks connections. We then cross‑reference these constructs with modules from *Theoretical Work FIL*.

## 1. Placement in the overall pipeline

```
LLM-in  →  ENCODER  →  FLOW-FIELD IR  →  DECODER  →  LLM-out
          (symbol→flow)                 (flow→symbol)
```

- **LLM‑in:** upstream transformer encodes the prompt/context to a latent vector \(x\in\mathbb{R}^n\).
- **Encoder \(\mathcal{I}\):** injects a **localized disturbance** \( \rho(\xi,0) = \rho_0(\xi) + \mathcal{I}(x) \) into the flow manifold \(M^d\).
- **Flow‑Field IR:** \(\rho(\xi,t)\) evolves under physical diffusion + a graph-derived potential \(\Phi\).
- **Read‑out/Decoder:** observables \(O_k[\rho]\) are linearly combined to produce a semantic vector \(z\), consumed by **LLM‑out** as conditioning context or prefix tokens.


---

## 2. Dimension catalogue for the manifold \(M^d\)

We model **semantics as flow in a high‑D space**. Candidate axes include sensory and rational dimensions with tunable “temperatures” \(\beta_i\) (controlling mixing).

| Tier | Source of dimension | “Temperature” weight \(\beta\) | Example coordinate(s) |
|-----:|---------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------|
| 1 | Sensory base | \(\beta_1\) | \((x,y)\) (vision), \(t\) (time), \(\lambda\) (colour), \(\phi\) (pitch/phoneme) |
| 2 | Sub‑channels | \(\beta_2<\beta_1\) | CIELAB L*, a*, b*; temporal bands (20 Hz vs 2 kHz), etc. |
| 3 | Derived percepts | \(\beta_3<\beta_2\) | “edge”, “face”, “syllable‑ID”, “chord class” |
| 4 | Rational strata | \(\beta_4 \to 0\) (cold) | proof‑depth \(\pi\in\mathbb{N}\), axiom IDs, algebraic structure tags |

- **Hot axes** (large diffusion constants \(D_i\), small \(\beta_i\)): sensory mixing, generalization.  
- **Cold axes** (small \(D_i\), large \(\beta_i\)): logical/proof evolution, near‑reversible.


---

## 3. Knowledge graph \(\to\) geometric potential \(\Phi\)

Let \(G=(V,E)\) be the directed knowledge graph; use **prime‑of‑primes encoding** to assign each node \(v\in V\) a unique integer \( \pi(v) \).

### 3.1 Node placement and shape
- Map \( \pi(v) \) to a lattice coordinate \( \mathbf{x}_v \in M^d \) (e.g., radix decomposition into selected axes).  
- Give node \(v\) a **kernel** \(K_v(\xi)\) with anisotropic covariance \(\Sigma_v\); let the **semantic inertia** \(w_v\) set its spatial scale \( \sigma_v \).

### 3.2 Potential field
The **obstacle/potential** is
\[
\Phi(\xi) \;=\; \sum_{v\in V} w_v \exp\!\Big(-\tfrac{1}{2}\,\langle \xi-\mathbf{x}_v,\,\Sigma_v^{-1}(\xi-\mathbf{x}_v)\rangle\Big).
\]
- High \(\Phi\) \(\Rightarrow\) “solid island” (no‑slip); low \(\Phi\) \(\Rightarrow\) open water.
- **Edges \(e_{uv}\)** are carved as **low‑\(\Phi\) tubes** along geodesics from \(\mathbf{x}_u\) to \(\mathbf{x}_v\), with width proportional to edge weight \(k_{uv}\).

> *FIL cross‑link:* \(\Phi\) realizes **truth‑determinants / attractors** as deep wells, and hallucination pockets as **cul‑de‑sacs** (high dwell‑time regions). “Precomputed wavefronts” correspond to gradient flows \(-\nabla\Phi\) seeded at attractors.


---

## 4. Dynamics: continuity + drift–diffusion on \(M^d\)

We evolve a density \(\rho(\xi,t)\) (belief mass) under a **metric \(g_{ij}\)**, diffusion tensor \(D^{ij}\), and potential \(\Phi\) from the graph.

### 4.1 PDE
\[
\partial_t \rho + \nabla_i(\rho\,v^i)=0, \quad
v^i \;=\; -\,D^{ij}\,\Big(\nabla_j \log \rho \;+\; \beta_j\,\nabla_j \Phi\Big).
\]

- \(D^{ij}=D_0\,g^{ij}\) (base diffusion projected by the manifold metric).  
- \(\beta_j\) controls “semantic temperature” per axis: hot perceptual axes mix; cold proof axes hug steepest‑descent “proof lines.”

### 4.2 Qualitative flow↔semantics correspondences
| Flow feature | Semantic interpretation |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| Kármán vortex street behind a wide “island” | Alternating certainty/uncertainty (belief drift) |
| Recirculation bubble | Dead‑end subgraph / hallucination pocket |
| Jet reattachment through a narrow tube | Highly reliable, low‑entropy transition (strong edge) |
| Strouhal ratio \(St=fD/U\) | **Semantic resonance** invariant of a motif |

> *Reservoir view:* \(\rho\) supports a rich spectrum of mixed modes; the physics performs the “timestep loop” otherwise simulated on GPUs.


---

## 5. Read‑out: flow observables \(\to\) symbols

Choose \(K\) probe points \(\{\xi_k\}\). Measure a vector of observables
\[
\mathbf{y}(t) = \big[\,\rho(\xi_k),\ \partial_t\rho(\xi_k),\ \nabla\rho(\xi_k)\,\big]_{k=1}^K.
\]
Aggregate over a short window and apply a **linear** read‑out:
\[
\hat{\mathbf{z}} \;=\; W_{\text{out}}\,\int_{t-\tau}^{t}\mathbf{y}(\tau)\,d\tau.
\]
- \(W_{\text{out}}\) is trained with ridge regression.  
- \(\hat{\mathbf{z}}\) conditions **LLM‑out** (e.g., as prefix vectors or adapter inputs).

> *FIL cross‑link:* This implements the **Semantic Action Principle** by turning physical dissipation patterns into a tractable vector proxy for **semantic action** / **ELP** fields.


---

## 6. Energy bookkeeping and why this can beat GPUs

### 6.1 Dissipation channels
- **Injection/drive:** pump power \(P_{\text{pump}} = Q\,\Delta P\).  
- **Viscous dissipation:** \( W_{\text{visc}} \approx \mu \int \omega^2\, dV\, dt \) (with vorticity \(\omega=\nabla\times \mathbf{u}\)).  
- **Control fields:** work \(\int f\cdot dx\) for electro‑osmotic or magnetic bias.  
- **Sensors:** dominated by ADCs; can be \(\mathcal{O}(\text{pJ})\) per sample if multiplexed.

### 6.2 Comparative (order‑of‑magnitude) numbers
- **GPU sampling (A100, 512×512, ~1000 steps):** \(\sim 200\ \text{J}\) per sample (illustrative).  
- **Micro‑flow IR:** \(\sim 1\ \text{mJ}\) per sample (nJ/step scale for mm–µm channels).  
- **Landauer floor (300 K):** \(k_BT\ln 2 \approx 2.9\times 10^{-21}\ \text{J/bit}\); for \(\sim 3\times 10^2\) “physical bits” per sentence \(\Rightarrow \mathcal{O}(1\ \text{pJ})\).

**Implication:** 5–8 orders of magnitude head‑room vs GPUs, and still 3–6 decades above Landauer, leaving aggressive room for future miniaturization and reversibility tricks.


---

## 7. Landauer, correlations, and non‑equilibrium effects

### 7.1 Classical Landauer (uncorrelated erase)
\[
E_L \;=\; k_{B}T\ln 2 \quad \text{per erased bit.}
\]

### 7.2 Correlation‑aware Landauer
If a bit \(X\) is correlated with \(Y\),
\[
W_{\min} \;=\; k_{B}T\big(\ln 2 - I(X;Y)\big).
\]
- Perfectly reconstructible state (\(I=1\) bit) \(\Rightarrow\) **no** dissipative cost.  
- **Linguistics link:** if an internal symbol is derivable from context, erasing it is free in principle—this favours **reversible proof‑axis** operations and reuse of cached structure.

### 7.3 Non‑equilibrium overhead (Jarzynski / Crooks)
Finite‑time protocols incur extra dissipation quantified by work fluctuations \(\sigma_W^2\). Faster operations \(\Rightarrow\) larger \(\sigma_W\) \(\Rightarrow\) higher energy above \(E_L\).  
- In the IR, higher diffusion \(D\) and hotter axes increase fluctuations and overhead; “cold” logical axes can be run quasi‑reversibly.


---

## 8. Crosswalk to *Theoretical Work FIL*

| FIL construct | Flow‑IR realisation |
|---------------|---------------------|
| **Semantic Action Principle** | Action \(S[\rho]\) via dissipation integrals; minimization corresponds to stable, low‑work semantic flows. |
| **Belief graph, truth‑determinants, attractors** | Deep wells in \(\Phi\); precomputed **wavefronts** are gradient flows from attractors. |
| **Semantic inertia** | Node mass \(w_v\) sets kernel widths \(\sigma_v\) and slows local erasure—lower non‑eq overhead. |
| **ELP field** (Expected Local Perturbation) | Local variability of \(\rho\), e.g., \( \text{Var}[\rho|\xi] \), or energy density \( \rho\,\|\nabla\log\rho\|^2 \). |
| **Cardinality Cascade / energy constraint** | Flow bandwidth allocated by \(D^{ij}\) and \(\beta_i\); hotter axes receive more capacity under a fixed power budget. |
| **Voronoi / Delaunay semantics** | Obstacle kernels \(K_v\) induce Voronoi‑like partitioning; edge tubes trace Delaunay‑like connectors. |
| **Minkowski cones / shadow regions** | Anisotropic \(g_{ij}\) + axis‑dependent \(D_i\) define reachable “cones” (downsets) and **shadow regions** with long residence times. |
| **Nibbler / path correction** | First‑passage times and controlled drifts implement path selection and **shortest corrective routes** from F to T regions. |
| **Semantic double‑slit** | Interference between two attractor wells in \(\Phi\) yields oscillatory wakes (alternating certainty)—observable in vorticity. |

## 9. Minimal working example (MWE)

- **Axes:** \( (x,y,\lambda,t,\pi) \) = 5D: visual plane, colour, time, proof‑depth.  
- **Graph motif:** A (axiom) \(\to\) L (lemma) \(\to\) T (theorem) with a competing false attractor F.  
- **\(\Phi\):** deep wells at T and F; tube A→L→T wider than A→F.  
- **Protocol:** inject at A; run for \(\tau=200\) ms equivalent; read out \(K=256\) probes.  
- **Outputs:** (i) probability of reaching T vs F (first‑passage), (ii) entropy production, (iii) average proof‑depth.  
- **Expected signature:** dominant jet A→L→T, weak recirculation near F; low Strouhal value around T well.

This MWE is ideal for both a lattice‑Boltzmann simulation and an initial PDMS micro‑fabricated 3‑layer chip.

## 10. Training and adaptation

1. **Hybrid loop (software first):**  
   - Fix \(\Phi\) from the graph; evolve \(\rho\) via LBM; train \(\mathcal{I}\) and \(W_{\text{out}}\) in PyTorch.  
2. **In‑hardware adaptation (long‑term):**  
   - Local “Hebbian” rule on \(\Phi\): grow obstacle radii in regions of high dissipated work, shrink elsewhere—encoding stable semantic channels.  
3. **Energy‑aware schedules:**  
   - Cold proof‑axis (\(\beta_\pi\!\to\!\infty\), \(D_\pi\!\to\!0\)) for near‑reversible steps; hot sensory axes for generalization, then cool to lock‑in.


---

## 12. Open research agenda (prioritized)

1. **Energy–information calculus:** prove \(\dot Q = \sum_i \beta_i\,\dot I_i\) for the IR and bound total work per sample.  
2. **Action functional \(S[\rho]\):** derive a FIL‑compatible action whose Euler–Lagrange equations recover §4.1.  
3. **Resolvent/spectral mapping:** tie dominant flow modes to graph motifs (resonances, Strouhal‑like invariants).  
4. **LBM on curved \(M^d\):** implement sparse 5–10D LBM with metric \(g_{ij}\).  
5. **3‑pillar PDMS chip:** (T, F, Attractor) with micro‑PIV read‑out; measure energy/sample vs a small GPU baseline.


---

## 13. Immediate decisions needed

- **Dimension set for v1.0** (finalize 5–8 axes).  
- **Target task** (tiny proof chain vs grounded captioning).  
- **Energy vs latency priority** (mJ/sample vs ms/sample).  
- **Simulation vs lab** (LBM notebooks vs mask design).


---

### Appendix A. Landauer, correlations, and IR operations

- **Erase:** costs \(k_B T(\ln 2 - I)\) per bit; minimize by maximizing reuse/correlation.  
- **Write (copy):** in principle reversible if performed quasi‑statically.  
- **Measure:** no fundamental lower bound, but practical sensor costs must be budgeted.  
- **Non‑eq speed penalty:** faster schedules increase work variance (Jarzynski), raising dissipation above the floor.
