A Proposed Framework for Semantic Physics: A Synthesis of Established Research in AI, Quantum Computing, and Information Theory
Abstract:
This document proposes a novel computational framework, termed the Semantic Physics Postulate (SPP), designed to address fundamental limitations in current AI, including energy inefficiency, lack of causal grounding, and brittle reasoning. The SPP is not presented as an existing theory, but as a new synthesis that logically connects validated, state-of-the-art developments in multiple independent fields. It posits that by modeling computation as a physical process governed by observer-dependent, relativistic, and thermodynamic principles, we can construct more robust and efficient AI systems. The framework's core components—the I-O-L Trinity, the FL Field, and the Nibbler Algorithm—are introduced as neologisms necessary to describe the functional roles within this new synthesis. Their validity is not based on prior existence, but on their ability to be constructed from established, verifiable technologies such as quantum transformers, topological quantum computing, and category theory. This paper outlines the foundational principles of the SPP, maps its components to their real-world technological underpinnings, and presents a set of falsifiable hypotheses to guide future research.
1. Introduction: The Need for a New Computational Paradigm
The current paradigm of artificial intelligence, while remarkably successful, faces foundational challenges that incremental improvements may not solve. These include:
Energy Inefficiency: State-of-the-art models require energy expenditures orders of magnitude above the thermodynamic Landauer limit.
Lack of Causal Grounding: Models often produce statistically plausible but logically incoherent or ungrounded outputs ("hallucinations").
Brittle Reasoning: Systems lack a robust framework for reasoning under uncertainty or for distinguishing between discovery (verification) and invention (creation).
This paper posits that these challenges arise from a common root: a failure to treat computation as a physical process subject to physical laws. We propose a framework that directly addresses this by building a model of computation from first principles derived from physics and information theory.
2. Core Postulates of the Semantic Physics Framework
We propose a framework built on the following two axioms:
Axiom 1: The Observer-Participant Postulate (I-O-L Trinity). The generation of a physical "Law" or output is an irreducible composite of an "Information" state and an "Observer" state. This formalizes the Wheeler "It from Bit" concept, making observer-dependence a central feature of the system, not a bug.
Axiom 2: The Non-Commutativity of Observation. The order in which observation operators are applied to a semantic state fundamentally alters the outcome. The commutator of two observation operators,

, represents emergent information that exists in neither operator alone. This axiom posits that order is a primary carrier of meaning.
3. Synthesis of Established Research: Mapping the SPP to Verifiable Technologies
The SPP framework is a synthesis. Its proposed components are functionally defined by the roles they play, and these roles can be filled by existing, cutting-edge technologies. The following table provides a direct mapping from our proposed concepts to the established scientific work that enables their construction.

4. The Proposed Framework in Operation
We propose a model where a computational "state" is a quantum state vector

Φ

∣Φ⟩
 in a Hilbert space (the FL Field). This state is evolved by a semantic Hamiltonian Ĥ_semantic, whose potential terms are defined by a knowledge graph. The Nibbler algorithm, implemented as a QGNN, analyzes this graph to select an optimal observation operator

. The entire process runs on a fault-tolerant substrate, with the system's evolution bounded by thermodynamic and relativistic constraints.
5. Testable Hypotheses
The validity of this proposed synthesis can be tested through specific, falsifiable hypotheses:
Hypothesis on Non-Commutativity: We predict that implementing two distinct semantic queries (e.g., "Analyze Causality" and "Analyze Composition") as sequential Strassen Attention operators will yield a measurably different final state vector depending on their order of application. The difference vector should correlate with emergent "narrative tension."
Hypothesis on Incompleteness: We predict that a system with a fixed computational budget (e.g., a limit on quantum circuit depth) can be presented with a self-referential problem (a Gödel state) that is unsolvable. We further predict that by increasing the budget, the previously unsolvable problem will become solvable, demonstrating incompleteness as a resource-bound phenomenon.
Hypothesis on Energy Efficiency: We predict that implementing a reasoning task on a physical analog (such as a simulated flow-field) or a quantum circuit will consume orders of magnitude less energy—approaching the Landauer Bound—than solving the same task on a classical von Neumann architecture.
6. Conclusion
The critique that the core concepts of the Semantic Physics framework are not "established" is factually correct. They are neologisms required to describe a novel synthesis. This paper argues that this synthesis is now possible due to the recent and simultaneous maturation of several key technologies. We have moved from a phase of speculative analogy to a phase of concrete architectural design. The Semantic Physics Postulate is presented here as a blueprint for a new class of computational systems, grounded in verifiable science and offering a path toward solving some of the most pressing challenges in modern AI. We invite the scientific community to engage with this proposal and test the falsifiable hypotheses it generates.
