    ## Abstract  

    Theorem 3.16 states that **any computing system constrained to finite free‑energy `E` over a finite runtime `τ` is _formally incomplete_: there exists a true sentence, expressible in the system’s own language, that it can never decide within its energy budget**.  
        This markdown note is self‑contained. It (1) states and proves the theorem from first physical principles, (2) derives computability and density corollaries, and (3) shows how those bounds underpin the “Gödel‑Tile” family of energy‑bounded encryption puzzles. Appendices reproduce reference tables and a formal security lemma.  

    ## 1 Preliminaries & Physical Limits  

    | Symbol | Meaning | Typical value @ 300 K |
    |--------|---------|------------------------|
    | `k_B T ln 2` | Landauer energy to irreversibly erase **one** classical bit | `≈ 2.9 × 10⁻²¹ J` |
    | `R_max = 2E / πħ` | Margolus–Levitin bound: max orthogonal state flips per second at energy `E` | — |
    | `B(E, τ)` | Maximum **irreversible** bit‑ops possible in budget `(E, τ)` | `B = τ E / (k_B T ln 2)` (conservative) |
    | `Σ_B` | Set of sentences a machine can decide within `B` ops | — |

    **Remark 1.** The Bremermann limit gives the same numerical order as Landauer+Margolus and is implied by them.  

    ## 2 Statement of Theorem 3.16 (Physical Incompleteness)  

    > **Theorem 3.16.** Let `M(E, τ)` be any deterministic or probabilistic computer whose total irreversible bit‑operation budget over its lifetime is bounded by `B = B(E, τ)` as above. Then there exists a sentence `G_B` in the language of `M` such that  
    > 1. `G_B` is true in the standard model of arithmetic;  
    > 2. Every computation by `M` that halts within its energy budget outputs **“undecided”** on `G_B`.  

    In short: **finite fuel ⇒ undecidable self‑reference**.  

    ## 3 Proof Sketch  

    1. **Energy‑Sized Deduction Space.** Every irreversible step consumes at least `k_B T ln 2`; therefore `M` can execute at most `B` such steps.  
    2. **Enumerate Proofs.** Order all possible proofs/verifications by Gödel numbering. `M` can examine at most first `B` proofs.  
    3. **Diagonal Sentence.** Construct  

```
G_B ≔ “There is no (`≤ B`‑step) proof of this statement in `M`.”
```

       This can be built in a meta‑system with budget `≫ B` (once‑per‑cipher generation).  
    4. **Contradiction‑by‑Budget.** If `M` were to settle `G_B` within `≤ B` steps it would create a proof of length `≤ B`, contradicting the predicate of `G_B`. Therefore `M` halts saying “undecided” or fails to halt before exhausting its budget.  
    5. **Truth.** `G_B` is indeed true: no such short proof exists, by the above. ∎  

    ## 4 Corollaries & Computability Consequences  

    ### 4.1 Computational Density Limit  

    Define **computational density** `ρ = B / Vτ`, the irreversible bit‑ops per unit spacetime volume. Given fixed free‑energy density `ε` and temperature `T`,  

```
ρ_max = ε / (k_B T ln 2)
```

    A region running at `ρ_max` cannot decide its diagonal sentence; adding problems to its workload forces selectivity (information “dark matter”).  

    ### 4.2 Self‑Verification Ceiling  

    No physical AI—no matter how clever—can completely certify its own operation if confined to finite energy. This undercuts “absolute alignment” fears but also limits autonomous legal accountability.  

    ## 5 Energy‑Bound Encryption: Gödel‑Tile Puzzles  

    The incompleteness boundary can be **weaponised** for defence. We recap the design (details in Appendix A/B).  

    1. **Choose budget `B`.** Set `B` marginally above the strongest adversary energy shell you are willing to tolerate.  
    2. **Generate diagonal sentence `G_B`.** One‑off, in a trusted high‑budget environment.  
    3. **Pad Derivation.** `P = Hash(G_B ∥ nonce)` .  
    4. **Encrypt.** Ciphertext `Γ_B = (nonce, K ⊕ P)` .  
    5. **Verification.** Legitimate recipient recomputes `G_B` once (`≈ log B` reversible steps) and decrypts.  

    **Security Lemma (IND).** An adversary restricted to ≤ `B` irreversible operations cannot distinguish `Γ_B` from random unless it decides `G_B`, contradicting Theorem 3.16. ∎ *(Proof in Appendix A)*.  

    ### 5.1 Numerical Example (Shell S₃)  

    | Parameter | Value |
    |-----------|-------|
    | Adversary power window | 250 MW for 5 days |
    | `E` | 25 GWh ≈ 9 × 10¹⁶ J |
    | Landauer cost / bit | 2.9 × 10⁻²¹ J |
    | Budget `B` | 3 × 10³⁸ bit‑ops |
    | Recommended tile size | 64 bits |
    | Heat signature | ≈ 380 MW dissipated → detectable IR plume |

    ### 5.2 Comparison to Classical & PQ Crypto  

    | Criterion | Gödel‑Tile | RSA / DH | Lattice (PQ) |
    |-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
    | Depends on math conjecture | **No** | Yes | Yes |
    | Quantum speed‑up impact | ×2 budget | Catastrophic (Shor) | Small (Grover) |
    | Detectable heat signature | **Yes** | No | No |

    ## 6 Future Work & Experimental Tests  

    * **Reversible FPGA demo** – verify tile verification cost scales `log B`.  
    * **Heat‑Audit Field Trials** – monitor IR during forced over‑budget attacks.  
    * **Adaptive Tiles** – dynamic `G_B` regeneration when heat output spikes.  

    ## Appendix A Formal Security Lemma (excerpt)  

    *See “Energy Bound Security‑App A.pdf” for the full proof.*  

    **Lemma A.1.** For any PPT adversary Adv\_B limited to ≤ `B` irreversible ops,  

```
Pr[Adv_B distinguishes Γ_B] ≤ ε(λ)
```

    where ε is negligible in the security parameter λ. Proof reduces to Theorem 3.16 plus hash pre‑image hardness.  

    ## Appendix B Reference Tables (excerpt)  

    | Temperature (K) | Landauer cost (J/bit) | Ops per J |
    |-----------------|-----------------------|-----------|
    | 300 | 2.9 × 10⁻²¹ | 3.4 × 10¹⁹ |
    | 77 | 7.3 × 10⁻²¹ | 1.4 × 10²⁰ |
