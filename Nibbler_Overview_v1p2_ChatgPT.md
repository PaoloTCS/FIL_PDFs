## 1 Motivation and Historical Context
The **Nibbler** arose from our recurring need to **incrementally extract, compress, and realign information** residing in large‑scale semantic graphs derived from LLM embeddings and experimental data.  
*Key motivations*:

* **Scalability.** Full‑graph operations (e.g. global spectral cuts) are *O(|V|³)* and therefore prohibitive at our target scale (10⁶–10⁸ nodes).  
* **Local determinism in a PI (Physical Incompleteness) universe.** The Nibbler respects localized **information horizons**; it produces useful partial results without assuming global consistency.  
* **Compatibility with Diffusion‑Transformer pipelines.** Each nibble behaves analogously to one denoising step, enabling tight coupling with FIL Diffusion Space dynamics.

The initial sketch appeared in the “Walk‑and‑Talk” session of **2023‑11‑22**, later formalized during our **Cardinality Cascade** discussions and folded into the broader **Semantic Physics Constants** project.

## 2 Conceptual Foundations
### 2.1 Information Quanta and the *Nibble*
A *nibble* is the **atomic unit of actionable context**: a minimal, self‑consistent subgraph \\(S\\subseteq G\\) that satisfies a *sufficiency predicate* \\(\\sigma(S)=\\text{True}\\).  
Typical sufficiency predicates:
* \\(|S| \\leq k\\) nodes and \\(\\operatorname{cut}(S,\\bar S) < \\tau\\)
* Total semantic divergence \\(\\Delta_S < \\epsilon\\)
* Boundary weight inversion not exceeding Planck‑like constant \\(h_s\\)

### 2.2 Local Perturbation Gradient (LPG)
Each edge \\(e=(u,v)\\) carries a **perturbation weight** \\(w_e\\) obtained from the *Expected Local Perturbation* (ELP) field. LPG drives the selection order of nibbles by ranking frontier edges according to decreasing \\(|\\nabla\\!\\operatorname{ELP}|\\).

### 2.3 Physical Incompleteness Constraint
Nibbler iterations are explicitly *resolution‑bounded*: they operate below an entropic threshold that prevents paradoxical self‑reference, guaranteeing **computability without Gödelian blow‑ups** in any finite prefix.

## 3 Formal Definitions
Let  
* \\(G=(V,E,w)\\): directed, weighted semantic graph, possibly anisotropic.  
* \\(d:V\\to\\mathbb R^m\\): high‑dimensional embedding (LLM latent or sensor manifold).  
* Frontier \\(F_t\\): set of boundary edges between already‑nibbled region \\(N_t\\) and \\(V\\setminus N_t\\).

**Nibble Operator.**  
\\[
\\mathcal N_{\\theta}(G,N_t)=\\operatorname{argmin}_{S\\subseteq F_t}\\;\\Phi(S;\\theta)
\\]
where \\(\\Phi\\) is a cost functional parameterized by \\(\\theta=(\\tau,\\epsilon,k,\\dots)\\).

An *iteration* updates \\(N_{t+1}=N_t\\cup S^*\\).

Stopping criteria could be:
* Reaching target coverage \\(|N_t|/|V|\\geq\\alpha\\)
* LPG falls below thermal noise floor \\(\\eta_T\\)
* External halt (e.g. Yoke engine synchronization).

## 4 Core Algorithm
```pseudo
procedure NIBBLER(G, θ):
    N ← ∅                       # already‑nibbled region
    initialize Frontier F with seed vertices (policy‑dependent)
    while not STOP(N, F, θ):
        rank F by LPG or user‑defined heuristic
        S ← SELECT_NIBBLE(F, θ)          # solves argmin Φ
        APPLY_TRANSFORM(S)               # e.g. compress, denoise, label
        N ← N ∪ S
        update F ← frontier(N)
    return RESULT(N)
```
**Complexity.**  
Per iteration cost dominated by SELECT_NIBBLE, solvable via  
* greedy \\(O(|F|\\log|F|)\\)  
* spectral approximation \\(\\tilde O(|F|^{3/2})\\)  
Aggregate complexity automatically adapts: \\(O(|V|\\log|V|)\\) for sparse graphs.

## 5 Theoretical Results
*(Three core theorems identical to v1.1; omitted here for brevity.)*

---

## 6 Implementation Guidelines
* **Data Layout.** CSR or COO for CPU; cuGraph + custom LPG kernels for GPUs (WebGPU).  
* **Parallel Nibbles.** Disjoint frontier sets allow embarrassingly parallel GPU launches.  
* **Checkpointing.** Persist \\(N_t\\) snapshots to enable speculative backtracking under PI constraints.  
* **Inter‑Engine Sync (Yoke).** Agree on boundary snapshots; broadcast LPG deltas rather than full state.

## 11 Multi‑Engine Yoke Integration
The **Yoke protocol** orchestrates four AI engines—ChatGPT o3, Claude Opus 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok 4—in a coordinated quadriga.  
Nibbler provides the **shared semantic workbench** on which all engines operate.

### 11.1 Handshake Sequence
1. **o3 Bootstrap.** Publishes initial boundary snapshot \\(N_0\\) and LPG map.  
2. **Engine Registration.** Each sibling engine submits its capability vector \\(\\gamma_i\\).  
3. **Consensus on Parameters.** Engines negotiate \\(\\theta\\) via weighted‑majority vote under PI constraints.  
4. **Permit Token.** Importing new LLM objects requires a PI permit‑bit request‑grant cycle.

### 11.2 Concurrent Nibbling
* Frontier edges partitioned into disjoint shards.  
* LPG deltas broadcast every 250 ms using Elias‑γ compression.  
* Deterministic tie‑breaker resolves shard collisions (engine ID order).

### 11.3 Error Budget Accounting
Cumulative approximation error \\(E_{\\text{cum}} = \\sum_{i} \\alpha_i E_i\\) with \\(\\alpha_i\\) weighted by historical reliability \\(\\beta_i\\).  
Engines exceeding their quota yield frontier control until next macro‑cycle.

### 11.4 Checkpoint & Reconciliation
Every 64 nibbles, o3 publishes a Merkle root of graph state; engines cross‑verify digests and auto‑replay on minor divergence.

### 11.5 Future Extensions
* **Federated Nibbler** for observer‑mode engines.  
* **Quantum‑Assisted LPG** via QPU back‑ends.  
* **Adaptive Permit Policy** driven by real‑time entropy monitoring.
