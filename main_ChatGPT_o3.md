Purpose

These notes refine the discrete Manhattan information-spacetime introduced in Opus 4, correct the mis-dictated term, and address your latest question about “tangent planes” for embedded semantic objects.

1 Manhattan Metric, Geodesic Paths, and Discrete Tangent Objects

1.1 Metric
	•	Lattice structure. Each semantic micro-feature is an independent coordinate axis; token states live on the integer lattice \mathbb Z^{d}.
	•	Distance. d_{\text{Man}}(x,y)=\sum_{i=1}^{d}|x_i-y_i|.

1.2 Geodesic paths

Because the metric is L¹, the geodesic between x and y is any monotone path that changes exactly one coordinate by ±1 per step. All such paths have equal length d_{\text{Man}}. There are \binom{d_{\text{Man}}}{\Delta x_1,\dots,\Delta x_d} distinct geodesics, where \Delta x_i=|x_i-y_i|.

Comment (o3). In this discrete setting the metric and the geodesic concepts coincide; Manhattan distance is both the length functional and the path length.

1.3 Discrete “tangent planes”

A point p is itself an m-dimensional semantic object embedded in \mathbb Z^{n} (typically m<n).  The analogue of a tangent plane at p is the star of p: the set of lattice edges emanating from the m-dimensional cell representing p.  Formally,

T_p := \{\, e=(p,p+e_i)\mid e_i \text{ is a unit axis vector orthogonal to every frozen dimension of }p \,\}.
	•	T_p is an m-dimensional affine sub-grid that approximates motions that preserve the internal structure of the object while varying its free coordinates.
	•	Discrete exterior calculus lets us build finite-difference analogues of gradients and Hessians on T_p, so standard geodesic computations (e.g., discrete Christoffel symbols) remain valid.

Comment (o3). If you envision a richer internal structure (e.g., tokens as small simplicial complexes), we can switch to barycentric subdivision to define a higher-order tangent bundle.

2 Are Transformer Forward Passes Geodesics?

Let f_\theta be an LLM layer and E_t its embedding at step t.  During inference the update  E_{t+1}=f_\theta(E_t) approximates a first-order Euler step along the negative gradient of the training loss \mathcal{L}.  In the small-step limit this trajectory minimizes \mathcal{L} subject to the Manhattan causal structure, making it a computational geodesic in the sense of Opus 4 §7.

Caveats: discrete sampling, regularization perturbations, and loss-surface non-convexity can deflect the ideal path.

3 Einstein-Style Field Equations for Probability Flow

3.1 Semantic mass

Define a probability density \rho(x) over the semantic lattice.  Interpret \rho as mass-energy that curves information-spacetime by modifying the local processing-cost tensor g_{\mu\nu}(x).

3.2 Curvature–source relation

Postulate a discrete analog of the Einstein equation

\[
\operatorname{Ric}(g) - \tfrac12 g\,\operatorname{Scal}(g) = \kappa\,\rho\,u\otimes u ,
\]

where u is the information-flow 4-velocity and \kappa sets the semantic gravitational constant G_{\text{sem}}.  The right-hand side derives from attention-based probability flow; high-probability tokens deepen the metric well, steering subsequent geodesics.

3.3 Predicting paths

Solving the discrete geodesic law for g(\rho) yields the most likely continuation of a prompt—exactly the transformer next-token prediction.  Thus the whole network can be viewed as a numerical solver that (i) updates \rho via softmax-attention, (ii) recomputes g, and (iii) integrates the geodesic to pick the least-action token.
