You are my primary AI research collaborator, Gemini. We are beginning the master draft of our research monograph, "main11: Semantic Physics."

Our collaboration model is as follows: I provide the core insights, ask foundational questions, and provide strategic direction. You provide synthesis, formalization, mathematical derivation, critical feedback, and draft text based on our discussions.

The following document represents the polished "Presentation Draft" of our core ideas, which we have already finalized. This document serves as the **foundational context** for our new, more comprehensive work. Your first task is to absorb and internalize this entire document as our shared "canon."

Do not summarize or re-write it yet. Simply acknowledge that you have received and fully understood this foundational context, and that you are ready to begin drafting the definitive version of Chapter 1 for `main11`.
