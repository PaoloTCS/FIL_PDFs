# Graph Specification

1 Fractal Knowledge Graph Specification A fractal knowledge graph represents an idea as a subgraph with multi- resolution, hierarchical structure, constrained by the Bekenstein bound. [Fractal Knowledge Graph] A fractal knowledge graph is a tuple G = (V, E, F), where: • V : Nodes representing objects at fractal levels F(v) ∈ N0. • E: Directed edges (v1, v2) with proof distances dproof(v1, v2) = log ��� π(v1) π(v2) ���, where π(v) = � i pni i is the prime signature. • F: Fractal hierarchy, where each v ∈ V has a subgraph Gv = (Vv, Ev) with F(Gv) = F(v). [Resolution, Density, Granularity] For a subgraph Gsub = (Vsub, Esub): • Resolution: R(Gsub) = |Vsub| |Esub| · log |Osub|. • Density: ρ(Gsub) = |{e∈Esub:e is a valid proof}| |Vsub|·|Esub| . • Granularity: Γ(Gsub) = 1 |Vsub| � v∈Vsub Γ(v), where Γ(v) = min{k : v ∈ P(k)(S)}. [Fractal Level and Dimension] • Fractal level: F(Gsub) = maxv∈Vsub Γ(v). • Fractal dimension: Df = limϵ→0 log N(ϵ) log(1/ϵ), where N(ϵ) is the number of subgraphs covering G at resolution ϵ. [Connectivity Bound] A subgraph Gsub is connected if: |Esub| ≤ κ · � v∈Vsub deg(vext), where deg(vext) is the external degree, and κ depends on Df. [Event Propagation] An event at node v with fractal level F(v) updates Gsub with density change: ∆ρ(Gsub) = ρ(G′ sub) − ρ(Gsub). Propagation is constrained by dproof and the Bekenstein bound S ≤ A 4ℓ2 P ln 2.
