Mathematical Theory of Observational Influence Fields: From Big Bang Perturbations to Semantic Cellular Automata Paolo Pignatelli June 3, 2025 Abstract We develop a comprehensive mathematical framework for observational influence fields, establishing observations as the fundamental building blocks of semantic space. Starting from the primordial observation at the Big Bang, we construct a field theory where observa- tions create perturbation fields that govern probability, semantic distance, and information propagation. The theory is implemented through observation-based cellular automata with explicit computational rules. This work provides the mathematical foundation for the Fun- damental Interaction Language (FIL) framework and its applications to artificial intelligence systems. Contents 1 Introduction The fundamental principle underlying this work is that observations, not abstract mathe- matical constructs, form the primary building blocks of semantic and physical reality. An observation is defined as any physical interaction that results in a measurable, distinguishable change of state. From the first particle formation at the Big Bang to complex semantic pro- cessing in artificial intelligence systems, all information structures emerge from sequences of concrete observations. This document develops the complete mathematical formalism for observational influence fields and provides computational rules for their implementation through cellular automata. 2 Part I: Mathematical Formalism for Observational Influence Fields 2.1 Foundational Definitions Definition 2.1 (Observation Space). Let Ω be the space of all possible observations, where each observation O ∈ Ω is characterized by: O = (sbefore, einteraction, safter, t, x) where: • sbefore, safter ∈ S (state space) • einteraction ∈ E (interaction events) • t ∈ R+ (timestamp) 1 Paolo Pignatelli Observational Influence Fields • x ∈ Rn (spatial location) Definition 2.2 (Observational Influence Function). For an observation Oi at position xi and time ti, the influence function is: Ii(x, t) : Rn × R+ → R+ satisfying: 1. Locality: Ii(x, t) → 0 as |x − xi| → ∞ 2. Causality: Ii(x, t) = 0 for t < ti 3. Conservation: � space � time Ii(x, t) dx dt = Ei (finite energy) Definition 2.3 (Observational Influence Field). The total influence field at point (x, t) is: Φ(x, t) = � i:ti≤t Ii(x, t) 2.2 Theoretical Framework Theorem 2.4 (Influence Field Dynamics). The observational influence field evolves according to: ∂Φ ∂t = D∇2Φ − λΦ + � i δ(x − xi)δ(t − ti)Ei where: • D: diffusion coefficient (influence spreading rate) • λ: decay constant (influence fade rate) • Ei: influence strength of observation Oi Proof. The equation combines three physical principles: 1. Diffusion: ∇2Φ (influence spreads spatially) 2. Decay: −λΦ (influence diminishes over time) 3. Sources: δ-functions (observations create influence) This is the standard form for a diffusion equation with sources and decay. Theorem 2.5 (Green’s Function Solution). The influence field has the explicit solution: Φ(x, t) = � i EiG(x − xi, t − ti) where G(x, τ) is the Green’s function: G(x, τ) = (4πDτ)−n/2 exp � − |x|2 4Dτ − λτ � H(τ) and H(τ) is the Heaviside step function ensuring causality. Proof. Direct verification by substitution into the PDE. The Green’s function satisfies: ∂G ∂τ = D∇2G − λG + δ(x)δ(τ) with initial condition G(x, 0) = δ(x). Corollary 2.6 (Influence Kernel). The influence between observations Oi and Oj is: K(Oi, Oj) = Ii(xj, tj) = EiG(xj − xi, tj − ti) 2 Paolo Pignatelli Observational Influence Fields 2.3 Perturbability Formalism Definition 2.7 (Local Perturbability). The perturbability at point (x, t) is defined as: Π(x, t) = |∇Φ(x, t)| + α∂Φ ∂t where α weights temporal vs spatial sensitivity. Theorem 2.8 (Perturbability Evolution). The perturbability field satisfies: ∂Π ∂t = D∇2Π − λΠ + β|∇Φ|2 + � i δ(x − xi)δ(t − ti)Pi where: • β: nonlinear coupling between influence and perturbability • Pi: perturbability injection from observation Oi Definition 2.9 (Mutual Perturbability). For two influence fields ΦA, ΦB, the mutual perturba- bility is: Πmutual(x, t) = |∇ΦA · ∇ΦB| exp � −|∇ΠA − ∇ΠB| σ � where σ is the gradient alignment scale. 2.4 Probability Measures Theorem 2.10 (Observational Probability Density). The probability density for a new obser- vation at (x, t) is: ρ(x, t) = Z−1Π(x, t) exp � −S[x, t] ℏobs � where: • Z: normalization constant • S[x, t]: action functional • ℏobs: observational quantum (related to ℏlang) Definition 2.11 (Action Functional). S[x, t] = � t 0 �1 2m| ˙x|2 + Veff(x, τ) � dτ where Veff(x, τ) = − log Φ(x, τ) is the effective potential. Theorem 2.12 (Path Integral Formulation). The probability amplitude for observational path γ : x(t0) → x(t1) is: A[γ] = � Dx(t) exp �iS[x] ℏobs � � t Π(x(t), t)1/2 3 Paolo Pignatelli Observational Influence Fields 2.5 Distance and Metric Structure Definition 2.13 (Observational Distance). The distance between observations Oi, Oj is: dobs(Oi, Oj) = � pathij 1 Π(x, t) ds where the integral is over the shortest path of highest perturbability. Theorem 2.14 (Metric Properties). The observational distance satisfies: 1. Positivity: dobs(Oi, Oj) ≥ 0 2. Symmetry: dobs(Oi, Oj) = dobs(Oj, Oi) (in equilibrium) 3. Triangle Inequality: dobs(Oi, Ok) ≤ dobs(Oi, Oj) + dobs(Oj, Ok) Definition 2.15 (Observational Metric Tensor). In continuous limit: gµν(x, t) = Π(x, t)−1δµν + α∂µ∂ν log Π(x, t) 2.6 Energy and Conservation Laws Theorem 2.16 (Observational Energy Conservation). Total observational energy is conserved: d dt � �1 2Π(∇Φ)2 + 1 2λΦ2 � dx = 0 Definition 2.17 (Observational Stress-Energy Tensor). Tµν = Π∂µΦ∂νΦ − 1 2gµν � Π(∇Φ)2 + λΦ2� Theorem 2.18 (Observational Field Equations). The influence field satisfies Einstein-like equa- tions: Rµν − 1 2Rgµν = κTµν where Rµν is the curvature of observational spacetime. 3 Part II: Computational Rules for Observation-Based Cellular Automata 3.1 Discrete Observational Lattice Definition 3.1 (Observation Lattice). Discretize space-time into cells Ci,j,k,t where each cell can contain at most one observation per time step. State Variables per Cell: Each cell Ci maintains: statei = {Oi : current observation (if any), (1) Φi(t) : local influence field value, (2) Πi(t) : local perturbability, (3) historyi : recent observation sequence} (4) 4 Paolo Pignatelli Observational Influence Fields 3.2 Basic Update Rules Rule 1: Influence Propagation At each time step t → t + 1: Φi(t + 1) = (1 − λ∆t)Φi(t) + D · ∆t · � j∈neighbors(i) Φj(t) − Φi(t) |j − i|2 + sourcei(t) (5) where sourcei(t) = Ei if observation occurs at cell i at time t, else 0. Rule 2: Perturbability Update Πi(t + 1) = f � |∇Φi(t)|, ∂Φi ∂t , nonlinear terms � where ∇Φi is computed using finite differences from neighbors. Rule 3: Observation Triggering A new observation occurs in cell i if: Ptrigger = Πi(t) · g(local configuration) > thresholdi where g(local configuration) depends on neighboring observations. 3.3 Advanced Computational Rules Rule 4: Observation Type Selection When triggered, the observation type is selected probabilistically: P(observation type = k) ∝ exp � − Ek kBTsemantic � where Ek is the ”semantic energy” of observation type k. Rule 5: Influence Injection When observation Oi occurs: Φi(t + 1) += Ei (6) Πi(t + 1) += Pi (7) ∀j ∈ neighbors(i) : influence flow i → j based on gradient (8) Rule 6: Memory Integration historyi(t + 1) = decay factor × historyi(t) + current observation (9) semantic depthi = � historyi weighted by recency (10) 3.4 Semantic Thread Formation Rule 7: Thread Initiation A semantic thread starts when: correlation(Oi, Oj) > thread threshold ∧ temporal proximity(Oi, Oj) Rule 8: Thread Propagation Once a thread γ exists, its influence on cell i is: thread influencei = � Ok∈γ K(Ok, positioni) × thread strength(γ) Rule 9: Thread Interaction When threads γA and γB intersect at cell i: Pmerge = mutual perturbability(γA, γB) × alignment factor 5 Paolo Pignatelli Observational Influence Fields 3.5 Convergence and Stability Rule 10: System Equilibrium The system reaches equilibrium when: |Φi(t + 1) − Φi(t)| < ϵΦ ∀i (11) |Πi(t + 1) − Πi(t)| < ϵΠ ∀i (12) Rule 11: Pattern Recognition Stable patterns emerge when: ∃ subset S of cells: correlation matrix(S) has dominant eigenvalue > threshold 3.6 Implementation Algorithm Algorithm 1 Observation Cellular Automaton function ObservationCellularAutomaton(grid, time steps) for t = 1 to time steps do UpdateInfluenceFields(grid) UpdatePerturbabilities(grid) TriggerNewObservations(grid) UpdateSemanticThreads(grid) DecayHistoricalInfluences(grid) DetectEmergentPatterns(grid) end for return grid end function 3.7 Connection to Florence Conjecture The computational rules implement the Florence Conjecture as: Preconvergence(γA, γB) = � cells in intersection influenceA[cell] × influenceB[cell] normalization × alignment factor[cell] (13) This discrete formulation directly implements the continuous integral: Preconvergence(γA, γB) ∝ � Ci∈ΓA∩ΓB (δFA(Ci) · δFB(Ci)) · exp(−|∇dA(Ci) − ∇dB(Ci)|) 4 Conclusions and Future Directions This mathematical framework establishes observations as the fundamental building blocks of semantic reality, providing both continuous field-theoretic descriptions and discrete computa- tional implementations.
