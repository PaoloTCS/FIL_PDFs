# Integration Discovery Invention UIL Framework

Integration of the Discovery-Invention Spectrum into the UIL Framework 1 Overview We aim to create a unified framework that: • Combines the knowledge generation processes (discovery and invention) with UIL’s knowledge evolution and interaction mechanisms. • Incorporates confidence measures and security levels into UIL’s mathe- matical structures. • Enhances the existing Nibbler Algorithm and graph representations to accommodate new functionalities. 2 Mathematical Integration 2.1 Extending the UIL Framework Definitions: Let G = (V, E) be the directed graph representing the knowledge structure in UIL. • V : Set of nodes (vertices) representing knowledge states or linguistic units. • E: Set of edges representing interactions or transformations between nodes. We introduce additional functions and measures: • Discovery Function ∆: Captures knowledge deduced within the existing graph. • Invention Function Φ: Represents the introduction of new knowledge based on external inputs. • Confidence Measures cd(ω) and ci(ω): Quantify the reliability of dis- covered and invented knowledge. • Security Levels λ(ω): Assign security attributes to knowledge elements. 1 2.2 Formal Definitions 2.2.1 Discovery Function ∆ Function: ∆ : G → Ωd • G: Current knowledge graph. • Ωd: Set of discoverable knowledge objects within G. Condition for Discovery: ∆(G) = {ω ∈ Ωd | ∃ a proof path p ⊆ G to ω} (1) Proof Path p: A sequence of nodes and edges in G leading to ω. 2.2.2 Invention Function Φ Function: Φ : I × G → Ωi • I: Set of external information inputs. • Ωi: Set of invented knowledge objects. Result of Invention: Φ(i, G) = ωi where ωi /∈ V prior to the invention (2) 2.2.3 Confidence Measures For Discovery: cd(ω) = � 1, if ω is deducible via a valid proof path in G 0, otherwise (3) For Invention: ci(ωi) = f(v(ωi), s(ωi)) (4) • v(ωi): Validation level of ωi. • s(ωi): Source reliability. • f: A function mapping v and s to a confidence score [0, 1]. 2.2.4 Security Levels λ(ω) Assignment: Each knowledge object ω is assigned a security level λ(ω) ∈ Λ, where Λ is an ordered set of security levels. 2 2.3 Integration into Graph Structures 2.3.1 Augmented Node Representation Node Attributes: Each node v ∈ V is now represented as: v = (ω, c(ω), λ(ω)) (5) where: • ω: Knowledge object. • c(ω): Confidence measure (cd(ω) or ci(ω)). • λ(ω): Security level. 2.3.2 Edge Representation Edges e ∈ E may also carry attributes, such as: • Transformation Type: Indicates whether the edge represents discovery or invention. • Security Constraints: Ensures interactions comply with security policies. 2.4 Updated Nibbler Algorithm (NA) Algorithm Adjustments: • Incorporate Confidence Measures: During compression and propa- gation, the NA considers c(ω) to prioritize high-confidence knowledge. • Security Compliance: The NA checks λ(ω) to ensure that knowledge propagation adheres to security constraints. Differential Encoding Function with Confidence and Security: For nodes vi and vi+1: ∆(vi, vi+1) = min(information change between vi and vi+1 | λ(vi+1) ≥ λmin) (6) where λmin is the minimum required security level. Compression Criteria: • High Confidence: Prioritize paths where c(ω) is high. • Security Levels: Ensure λ(vi+1) is appropriate for the propagation. 3 3 Formal Theorems and Proofs 3.1 Knowledge Compression with Confidence Theorem 1: Confidence-Weighted Knowledge Compression K = n � i=1 c(ωi) · ∆(vi, vi+1) (7) The total compressed knowledge K is the sum of the weighted differential en- codings, factoring in confidence measures. 3.2 Security-Constrained Path Optimization Theorem 2: Secure Path Optimization Popt(vi, vj) = min P (vi→vj) d(vi, vj) subject to λ(vk) ≥ λmin ∀vk ∈ P (8) 4 Operational Rules 4.1 Discovery Process • Verify proof path existence. • Confirm graph boundary adherence. • Ensure λ(ωd) ≥ minv∈p λ(v). Confidence Assignment: cd(ωd) = 1 if all conditions are met. 4.2 Invention Process • Validate external information source i. • Create new graph boundary Gωi. • Define shell boundaries and security domains. • Compute confidence: ci(ωi) = f(v(ωi), s(ωi)) Security Level Assignment: λ(ωi) = min(λsource, λdomain) 5 Conclusion Integrating the Discovery-Invention Spectrum Framework into the UIL frame- work enriches the model by: • Enhancing Knowledge Generation: Incorporating both discovery and in- vention processes. 4 • Improving Reliability: Using confidence measures to assess knowledge trustworthiness. • Ensuring Security: Assigning and enforcing security levels throughout the knowledge graph. • Strengthening Formal Foundations: Extending mathematical models to accommodate new functionalities.
