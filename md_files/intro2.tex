\subsection{Background and Motivation}

How are things connected? This is a fundamental question asked by children and by research scientists. Today's knowledge depth in particular fields is astounding, and with the new tools of A.I., this trend will accelerate. Understanding the fundamental principles that govern interactions within and across domains is however essential for advancing technology, science, and our comprehension of systems. Traditional models often treat these domains separately, lacking a unified framework that captures the essence of communication and information transfer in a holistic manner.

\subsubsection{Physical Systems}

Foundationally, physical systems are governed by interactions between entities, particles or fields, etc., where signals cause changes in states. Quantum mechanics, for instance, describes these interactions probabilistically, introducing concepts like energy quantization and state transitions.

\subsubsection{Linguistic Systems}

Human languages are complex structures that enable communication. They consist of symbols, grammar, and semantics, that form networks of meaning. The relationships between languages add another layer of complexity in the conveyance and transformation of information, involving translation, semantic mapping, and cross-lingual understanding.

\subsubsection{Computational Systems}

In the realm of computation, algorithms and data structures process and transmit information through networks. Concepts like state machines, information propagation, and semantic networks are central to understanding computational systems, and how they evolve and perform tasks. The rapid advancement of A.I. and its ability to interact with humans advances the frontier of machine human-machine communication, with many advancements expected in non-linguistic human-machine interactions (Robotics, Brain computer Interfaces, Text-to-video, etc.) .

Despite their apparent differences, these domains share underlying principles related to communication, interaction, and information processing:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, labelsep=5mm]
    \item \textbf{Signals and State Changes:} Whether in particle interactions, linguistic exchanges, or data transmissions, signals causing state changes are fundamental.
    \item \textbf{Networks and Relationships:} Entities are connected through networks, with relationships that can be represented mathematically.
    \item \textbf{Probabilistic and Deterministic Processes:} Systems may exhibit deterministic or probabilistic behaviors, influencing how information propagates and states evolve.
    \item \textbf{Quantization of Information:} Information often exists in discrete units, such as quanta in physics, words in language, or bits in computation.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Challenges in Existing Models}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, labelsep=5mm]
    \item \textbf{Fragmentation Across Disciplines:} Current models are specialized within their fields, making interdisciplinary research and application difficult.
    \item \textbf{Lack of Unified Formalism:} Without a common mathematical framework, integrating concepts from physics, linguistics, and computer science is challenging.
    \item \textbf{Inefficiency in Cross-Domain Applications:} Applying insights from one domain to another often requires redefining concepts, leading to inefficiencies and potential misunderstandings.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The Need for a Unified Framework}

Developing a unified framework that models fundamental interactions and communication across physical, linguistic, and computational systems, allows us to:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, labelsep=5mm]
    \item \textbf{Enhance Cross-Disciplinary Understanding:} enhance the transfer of concepts and methods between fields.
    \item \textbf{Improve Computational Models:} Create efficient algorithms that leverage underlying universal principles.
    \item \textbf{Advance Theoretical Insights:} Provide a deeper understanding of how information evolves in complex systems.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Contributions of This Paper}

We propose to integrate foundational concepts to develop this unified framework:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*, labelsep=5mm]
    \item \textbf{Fundamental Interaction Language (FIL):} A theoretical framework where any signal causing a change in an entity's state is considered a form of communicationâ€”a "language." FIL introduces entities, states, signals, thresholds, and quantized information. This outlook aligns closely with principles in quantum mechanics.

    \item \textbf{Language-Union (LU):} The concept of the Language Sum Graph $L(S)$, a unified graph structure that combines symbols (tokens) from multiple languages. By representing languages as graphs with syntactic, semantic, and contextual relationships, LU aids computational mapping across languages, enhancing multilingual natural language processing.

    \item \textbf{Nibbler Algorithm:} A tool using category theory that models state transitions, broadcasting, and semantic field evolution in networks. The Nibbler Algorithm tool allows us to explore deterministic and probabilistic events, their broadcasting, their quantized of information (words). Nibbler also uses other mathematical tools such as Voronoi tessellation to represent semantic fields.
\end{enumerate}

By integrating FIL, LU, and the Nibbler Algorithm, we aim to:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, labelsep=5mm]
    \item \textbf{Model Communication Universally:} Treat interactions across different domains as manifestations of the same fundamental processes.
    \item \textbf{Unify Mathematical Formalisms:} Employ category theory, graph theory, and other mathematical tools consistently across domains.
    \item \textbf{Enhance Applications:} Provide a foundation for advancements in quantum computing, natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and complex systems modeling.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Impact on Various Fields}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, labelsep=5mm]
    \item \textbf{Quantum Information Science:} Applying FIL's concepts can lead to new insights into all forms of computing, including quantum computing and information theory.
    \item \textbf{Natural Language Processing (NLP):} LU's unified graph structures, combined with the Nibbler Algorithm's broadcasting mechanisms, can improve multilingual NLP tasks such as language translations and multi-modal tasks, such as text-to image, text-to video, etc...
    \item \textbf{Artificial Intelligence (AI):} A unified framework allows for the deepening of understanding of AI systems, and help them evolve new communication processes.
    \item \textbf{Complex Systems:} Understanding how information propagates and evolves in networks aids in modeling biological systems, social networks, and other complex phenomena.
\end{itemize}

Unifying and analyzing seemingly disparate domains of knowledge comes with a price, a lack of depth. This paper sets the stage for a process whereby the advancement in any one field advances it through our unification to other fields. The integration of FIL, LU, and the Nibbler Algorithm provides a robust foundation for advancing our understanding and application of fundamental principles that govern diverse systems.
