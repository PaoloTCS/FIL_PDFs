Module: Information Acceleration and Observational Hierarchies April 1, 2025 1 Introduction This module extends our prior discussions by introducing acceleration in di- rected graphs as a model for information propagation. We examine the accu- mulation of information in a manner similar to viral spread, introduce a moving observation window mechanism, and relate hierarchical observations to training in neural networks. 2 Information Spread as Viral Propagation Let G = (V, E) be a directed graph representing an information network, where V denotes nodes (information states) and E denotes directed edges (information transfer). Define the strength of information at a node vi as a function S(vi) based on incoming information: S(vi) = � vj∈in-neighbors(vi) wjiS(vj) (1) where wji is a weight function representing the influence of node vj on vi. Consider a layered propagation model where the depth of nodes from an initial node v0 is defined as levels Lk. The probability of information reaching level Ln is proportional to the aggregated strength along paths: P(Ln) ∝ � p∈P0→n � (vi,vj)∈p wij (2) where P0→n represents all paths from v0 to level Ln. 3 Moving Window Encoding and Memory Op- timization Define a moving observation window Wt over an information trajectory. Let Wt maintain a record of recent nodes and encode previous states with a compression 1 function C. The update rule follows: Wt+1 = � {vt+1} ∪ Wt, if |Wt| < k {vt+1} ∪ C(Wt), otherwise (3) where k is the memory threshold, and C(Wt) compresses past nodes based on redundancy and relevance. A mathematical rule for dropping information is defined using an entropy threshold HT : H(Wt) = − � vi∈Wt P(vi) log P(vi) (4) where P(vi) is the frequency-based probability of encountering vi. If H(Wt) < HT , older nodes are removed. 4 Acceleration in Information Race Define the acceleration of information propagation between levels as: an = S(Ln) − S(Ln−1) ∆t (5) where S(Ln) is the cumulative information strength at level Ln and ∆t is the time step. The most influential paths maximize acceleration, defining an optimal information trajectory. 5 Observation as Training Observations are defined as changes in system state due to incoming signals. Define an observation function O as: O : X × I → X′ (6) where X is the state space, I is an input signal, and X′ is the updated state. Hierarchical observations align with layers in neural networks, where each layer Lk abstracts features from the previous layer: Lk = fk(Lk−1) (7) where fk represents a transformation function. 6 Conclusion This module formalizes information acceleration, hierarchical observations, and moving window optimization in information networks. These principles will be integrated into the next iteration of our main research document.
