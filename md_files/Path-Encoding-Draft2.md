Reﬁning Path Encoding within the FIL Framework: Addressing Non-Commutativity and Integrating Nibbler Concepts Conceptualization based on P. Pignatelli’s R&D (Summary of focused discussion) May 23, 2025 Abstract This document summarizes a focused discussion on developing Path Encoding ideas within the Fundamental Interaction Language (FIL) framework, as outlined in Pignatelli’s ’Uniﬁed Framework for Fundamental Interaction and Communication’ (main9.pdf, Sections 11 & 12). It builds upon prior conceptualization of a hierarchical Nibbler algorithm and a ’Semantic Physics’ context. A key outcome is the reﬁnement of how function/transformation composi- tion is encoded, addressing the general non-commutativity of such operations while preserving the uniqueness of path representations. 1 Introduction: Focusing on Path Encoding The discussion shifted to a dedicated exploration of Path Encoding, leveraging the established foun- dation of FIL, the Nibbler’s role in constructing hierarchical informational patterns from elemen- tal tokens (T1, T0), and the overarching ’Semantic Physics’ context (including Bekenstein-inspired bounds, fundamental constants like ℏlang, csem, Gsem, the Information-Observation-Language Triad, Semantic Lightcones, and Informational Curvature). The primary goals were to: • Detail the ’Function Composition Framework with Prime Encoding’ (main9, Sec 11). • Detail the ’Uniﬁed Prime Encoding for Analogical Graph Compression’ (main9, Sec 12). • Connect properties of Nibbler-constructed patterns (energy, complexity, fractal level) to their prime encodings. • Relate prime encodings to informational bounds and Semantic Physics constants. • Clarify the role of the Bidirectional Nibbler Search (main9, Alg. 2). 2 Analysis of Section 11 (main9.pdf): Function Composition Frame- work with Prime Encoding 2.1 Function Space Foundation and Prime Encoding π(f) The core properties of prime encoding for functions f ∈ F were reviewed: • Uniqueness: f ̸= g =⇒ π(f) ̸= π(g). 1 • Composition: π(f ◦ g) = π(f) ∗ π(g). (This became a key point of reﬁnement). • Factorization: π(f) factorizes iﬀ f decomposes into atomic function components. It was noted that the prime encoding π(f) for a function f (a FIL pattern) should reﬂect its Nibbler construction history and its ’energy cost’ Eentity and ’informational area’ Aentity, aligning with Bekenstein-like bounds. 2.2 Gap Analysis and Prime Factorization The concepts of Composition Distance dc(f, g), Gap Signature σgap(f, g), and Gap Completion were identiﬁed as crucial for Local Language Constructors (LLCs) and bridging domains within FIL. Prime factorization of π(f) reveals its constituent atomic function components, which are the primitive transformations recognized/constructed by the Nibbler. 2.3 Search State Representation and Synthesis The quantum state representation for function search, |ψf⟩ = ∑ ai|hi⟩, aligns with Nibbler’s quan- tum characteristics. The explicit mention of a "Quantum Nibbler search" for function synthesis (Theorem 11.6) was highlighted. 3 Analysis of Section 12 (main9.pdf): Uniﬁed Prime Encoding for Analogical Graph Compression 3.1 Voronoi-Prime Representation The deﬁnition of a Prime Graph Structure (nodes with prime signatures π(v), edges with prime weights pk, Voronoi cells by prime distance dπ) was reviewed. The prime signature π(v) of a Nibbler- pattern Pi could be its constructive function’s encoding or a product of constituent sub-pattern primes. 3.2 Analogical Operations and Hierarchical Compression Prime-based analogy (a : b :: c : d =⇒ π(d) ≈ π(b)π(c)/π(a)) was seen as a FIL inference mechanism. Hierarchical compression, linking π(v) magnitude to fractal levels, directly corresponds to the Nibbler’s layered construction. 3.3 Question-Answer Path Finding (Bidirectional Nibbler Search) This was identiﬁed as a key application, using Voronoi cell expansion in the prime-encoded graph, guided by Semantic Physics principles (e.g., Gsem, csem). 4 Key Reﬁnement: Addressing Non-Commutativity in Path Encod- ing A critical point of discussion arose regarding the composition property π(f ◦ g) = π(f) ∗ π(g). • The Challenge: Standard multiplication of prime encodings is commutative, but func- tion/transformation composition is generally non-commutative. This could lead to diﬀerent ordered compositions having the same prime product encoding, violating the Uniqueness property of π(f). 2 • Insight on Observation Rules and Ordinality: It was proposed that fundamental "Ob- servation rules" (inherent in the Observation operator O or the FL Field dynamics) determine the possible ordinal sequence of instantiated elemental tokens (T1, T0), establishing a basic sequentiality from the outset. • Resolution Proposal for Path Encoding: 1. Acknowledge Fundamental Non-Commutativity: Composition of atomic FIL func- tions is non-commutative at the base level. 2. Adopt Order-Preserving Encoding for Sequences/Paths: For an ordered path or sequence of transformations F = f1 ◦ f2 ◦ · · · ◦ fk, its encoding πseq(F) must be sensitive to the order. A **Gödel-style encoding** (e.g., πseq(F) = 2π(f1) · 3π(f2) · 5π(f3) . . ., where π(fi) is the unique prime of atomic function fi) is the preferred candidate. 3. Interpretation of π(f ◦g) = π(f)π(g): This rule from main9.pdf is now re-interpreted as a special case (e.g., for commutative operations) or as representing the encoding for a *set/bag of features/components* where order is irrelevant (like a node’s signature πnode(v)), distinct from encoding an ordered sequence of operations. 4. Factorization for Sequence Encodings: "Factorization" of πseq(F) means extracting the ordered sequence of constituent π(fi) from their prime bases and exponents. 5. Nibbler Discovers Eﬀective Commutativity: Higher-level Nibbler operations (Mi) can identify and abstract equivalence classes of diﬀerent operational sequences that lead to the same functional outcome at a given fractal level of FIL, thus establishing domains of "eﬀective commutativity." 5 Nature of Atomic Function Components These are the irreducible, fundamental operations within FIL on elemental states (T1, T0) or low- level Nibbler patterns. • Candidates include Identity, Negation/Flip (instantiation/erasure), and potentially basic Boolean-like or shift operations. • Each fatomic is assigned a unique small prime π(fatomic), possibly correlated with its energy cost E(fatomic) (related to ℏlang). • Complex functions are compositions of these, with their πseq reﬂecting this ordered composi- tion. • Their properties (E, A) are subject to Bekenstein-like bounds, ensuring a basis of truly "atomic" (non-decomposable beyond a certain complexity) functions. 6 Conclusion and Next Steps for Coding Chat This reﬁned understanding, particularly the adoption of order-preserving Gödel-style encodings for paths/sequences of operations, is critical for the next phase of development. The distinction between encoding ordered sequences and unordered sets of properties is vital. The coding chat for "Voronoi6- Path Encoding phase 3" should be primed with these considerations to ensure the implemented path encoding scheme is robust, unique for ordered compositions, and consistent with the hierarchical, constructive nature of FIL and the Nibbler.
