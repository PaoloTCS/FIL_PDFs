# Semantic Probability and Voronoi

Semantic Probability Chains and Multidimensional Voronoi Partitioning in Knowledge Graphs Paolo Pignatelli and ChatGPT Florence Project – Draft for Integration Abstract We present a unified framework linking semantic probability chains with high-dimensional Voronoi partitioning of knowledge and observation graphs. Starting from the notion that observations travel through directed paths in a knowledge space defined by empirical or formal proof steps, we derive a probability calculus rooted in the graph-theoretic structure. Voronoi partitions are then introduced as a means of tessellating this space into localized domains of influence, allowing for both probabilistic convergence analysis and dimension-wise trajectory signatures. This work provides foundational tools for modeling semantic drift, belief alignment, and the structured co-evolution of agent states. 1 Introduction Semantic reasoning and probabilistic inference are often treated as distinct domains: the former symbolic and structural, the latter statistical and numeric. Our objective is to unify them under a graph-based language model, where beliefs are terminal nodes, proofs are directed paths, and inference emerges as weighted traversal through a dynamically partitioned semantic field. 2 Semantic Probability Chains Let G = (V, E) be a directed graph where vertices V are semantic states and edges E represent transi- tions. Each edge encodes a transformation with a confidence or error weight. The total path probability is accumulated across steps, and drift is characterized as deviation from truth-aligned paths. 3 Graph-Based Probability and Bayesian Structure We interpret transitions using a conditional probability update rule: P(vj|vi, fk) = P(fk|vj)P(vj) P(fk|vi) where fk labels the transformation. Inverse edges and dual operations enable counterfactual reasoning. 4 Voronoi Partitioning in M-Dimensional Space A trajectory γ(t) is a path in a space Rm where dimensions correspond to attributes. Dimensional spread D(t) often follows a bell-shaped curve over the trajectory. Entropic midpoints indicate semantic divergence and learning curvature. 1 5 Voronoi Cells and Probabilistic Convergence Each Voronoi cell Ci hosts a local domain. Let pi(t) denote the probability of being in Ci at time t. The re-encounter field Fij(t) measures potential semantic convergence. Path signatures and minimal inter-cell distances inform the convergence probability Pre. 6 Generalization and Conclusion The model extends beyond dyadic human interaction to general data pairs. Applications include theory alignment, LLM drift tracking, and agent convergence. Future work includes defining semantic curvature and second-order dynamics.
