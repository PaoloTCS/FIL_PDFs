Observational Influence Fields and Semantic Energy Geometry Paolo Pignatelli (with ChatGPT) June 2025 Abstract This module develops a continuous and discrete mathematical framework for modeling se- mantic influence as a physical field. Beginning from a first-order formulation of observations as localized state changes in space and time, we derive the dynamics of influence fields, define perturbability metrics, and introduce observational distance, action, and energy conservation. A complementary discrete implementation via semantic cellular automata formalizes emergence and stability of knowledge structures. The module culminates in a field-theoretic implementa- tion of the Florence Conjecture. 1 Foundational Definitions Definition 1.1 (Observation). An observation O is defined as a quintuple: O = (sbefore, einteraction, safter, t, x) where sbefore, safter ∈ S (state space), einteraction ∈ E (interaction event), t ∈ R+ (timestamp), x ∈ Rn (spatial location). Definition 1.2 (Influence Function). For observation Oi at (xi, ti): Ii(x, t) : Rn × R+ → R+ subject to: • Locality: Ii(x, t) → 0 as |x − xi| → ∞ • Causality: Ii(x, t) = 0 for t < ti • Finite Energy: �� Ii(x, t) dx dt = Ei < ∞ Definition 1.3 (Total Influence Field).

It lays the theoretical foundation for path-integral reasoning, gradient-based semantic distance, and cellular automaton implementations of semantic cognition.
