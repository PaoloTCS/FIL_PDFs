# Computational Relativity  A Framework for Information Processing in Spacetime copy

Computational Relativity: A Framework for Information Processing in Spacetime Abstract We present a novel theoretical framework unifying computational complexity theory with relativistic spacetime principles. Building on the insight that computational reachability exhibits causal structure analogous to light cones in relativity, we derive a computational metric where information processing is bounded by fundamental physical limits. The framework establishes Shannon information bits as natural spatial units in computational spacetime, with processing rates bounded by a computational speed limit c_comp derived from the Landauer and Bremermann bounds. This leads to a Manhattan metric on tessellated information space where Local Language Constructors find geodesic paths and the Discovery-Invention spectrum corresponds to timelike versus spacelike separations in computational spacetime. 1. Introduction The relationship between computational resources and information accessibility exhibits striking parallels to the causal structure of spacetime in general relativity. Just as events outside the light cone cannot causally influence each other, computational states beyond certain resource bounds remain inaccessible from a given starting configuration. This paper develops this analogy into a rigorous mathematical framework that unifies information theory, computational complexity, and relativistic causality. 1.1 Core Insight The central observation is that computation exhibits intrinsic causal structure. If computational state s₂ requires more resources to reach from s₁ than are available, then s₂ is causally disconnected from s₁ in computational spacetime. This suggests that computation itself has relativistic properties governed by fundamental speed limits. 1.2 Contributions This work makes several key contributions: 1. Computational Spacetime Metric: A well-defined geometric structure for information processing 2. Physical Derivation of c_comp: The computational speed limit from Landauer and Bremermann bounds 3. Shannon Tessellation: Natural spatial units in computational spacetime 4. Causal Classification: Discovery vs Invention as timelike vs spacelike separation 5. Geodesic Optimization: Local Language Constructors as path minimization algorithms 2. Foundations: Physical Limits on Computation 2.1 Universal Computational Bounds All computation occurs in physical spacetime and must respect fundamental physical limits: Landauer Bound: Irreversible erasure of one bit requires minimum energy: Bremermann Bound: Time-energy uncertainty limits maximum processing rate: Speed of Light: Information cannot propagate faster than c in any physical medium. 2.2 Derivation of Computational Speed Limit Combining the Landauer and Bremermann bounds yields a fundamental computational speed limit. Theorem 2.1 (Computational Speed Limit): The maximum rate of information processing is: Proof: Assigning Landauer energy E_L to each bit operation and applying the Bremermann bound: Physical Interpretation: This establishes temperature-dependent computational causality - hotter systems can process information faster, but all systems face fundamental quantum-thermodynamic limits. 3. Computational Spacetime Geometry 3.1 Natural Computational Units The physical derivation of c_comp establishes natural units for computational spacetime: Fundamental time quantum: τ₀ = 1/c_comp (time to process one bit) Fundamental space quantum: 1 Shannon bit of information Conversion relation: 1 tessellation unit = c_comp × τ₀ = 1 bit E_L = k_B T ln(2) R_max = 2E/(πℏ) [operations/second] c_comp = (2 k_B T ln(2))/(πℏ) [bits/second] c_comp = R_max(E_L) = (2 E_L)/(πℏ) = (2 k_B T ln(2))/(πℏ) 3.2 Computational Spacetime Metric Definition 3.1 (Computational Spacetime Interval): For computational states in tessellated information space: where: t = regular computational time d_Manhattan = discrete bit-by-bit distance in information space c_comp = computational speed limit from Theorem 2.1 Justification: Information processing occurs discretely (bit-by-bit), making Manhattan distance the natural metric. Diagonal "shortcuts" through information space are impossible - each bit must be processed sequentially. 3.3 Tessellated Information Space The computational spacetime is tessellated with Shannon information bits as fundamental units: Tessellation cell = 1 bit of information Cell transitions = elementary computational operations Path length = total bits processed Processing time = path length / c_comp 4. Causal Structure and Light Cones 4.1 Computational Light Cones Definition 4.1 (Computational Light Cone): For computational state s at time t: This defines all computational states reachable from s within time (t'-t) given the fundamental processing limit c_comp. 4.2 Causal Classification of Computation Theorem 4.1 (Discovery-Invention Dichotomy): Computational processes fall into two causal categories: ds² = c²_comp dt² - d²_Manhattan(information_space) C⁺(s,t) = {s' : d_Manhattan(s,s') ≤ c_comp × (t'-t), t' ≥ t} 1. Discovery (Timelike): New information states reachable within computational light cone 2. Invention (Spacelike): New information states requiring external input Proof: Discovery operates within existing information structures, ensuring causal connectivity. Invention introduces genuinely new information requiring external input, corresponding to spacelike separation where direct causal influence is impossible. 4.3 Computational Causality Principle Axiom 4.1: No computational influence can propagate faster than c_comp through information space. This principle forbids "computational action at a distance" and ensures that all information processing follows causal chains through tessellated space. 5. Geodesics and Optimization 5.1 Computational Geodesics In computational spacetime, optimal processing paths minimize the action integral: where L_comp encodes the computational "energy" required for state transitions. Theorem 5.1 (Geodesic Optimization): Optimal computational paths satisfy the geodesic equation: where Γ^µ_νρ are computational Christoffel symbols encoding the tessellation structure. 5.2 Local Language Constructors as Geodesic Finding Theorem 5.2 (LLC-Geodesic Correspondence): Local Language Constructor bridges minimize computational path length: This establishes that LLC optimization naturally finds geodesics in computational spacetime. ds²(s,s') > 0, s' ∈ C⁺(s,t) ds²(s,s') < 0, s' ∉ C⁺(s,t) S = ∫ L_comp(x^μ, dx^μ/dt) dt d²x^μ/dt² + Γ^μ_νρ (dx^ν/dt)(dx^ρ/dt) = 0 B(L₁, L₂) = arg min_B d_Manhattan(path(L₁ → L₂)) 6. Information-Geometric Correspondence 6.1 Kernel-Metric Relationship Existing kernel methods in machine learning can be reinterpreted as distance measurements in computational spacetime: Theorem 6.1 (Kernel-Distance Correspondence): Information processing kernels encode proper distances: where d_Manhattan is the tessellated information distance. 6.2 Quantum-Computational Bridge The framework naturally connects to quantum information theory through the uncertainty principle: This quantum bound constrains the precision of computational state preparation and measurement. 7. Experimental Predictions and Validation 7.1 Testable Predictions The computational relativity framework makes specific, falsifiable predictions: 1. Light Cone Structure: Information influence in AI systems should show bounded, cone-like propagation 2. Manhattan Geometry: Optimal algorithms should follow Manhattan distance minimization 3. Temperature Scaling: Processing rates should scale as c_comp ∝ T 4. Causal Consistency: No genuine "computational action at a distance" 7.2 Proposed Experiments Experiment 1: Measure information propagation in transformer networks Track how input perturbations influence output through network layers Verify cone-like boundary structure with slope ∝ c_comp Experiment 2: Test LLC bridge optimality k(x₁, x₂) = exp(-d²_Manhattan(x₁, x₂)/(2σ²)) Δ_information × Δ_time ≥ ℏ/(2 ln(2)) Generate bridges between knowledge domains Verify that optimal bridges minimize Manhattan distance in embedding space Experiment 3: Computational interferometry Process same problem via different algorithmic paths Test for interference patterns when paths recombine 7.3 Falsification Criteria The theory fails if: Information propagates instantaneously (no cone structure) Optimal algorithms don't follow Manhattan geodesics Temperature scaling violates c_comp ∝ T prediction Genuine computational action at a distance is observed 8.
