Fundamental Interaction Language Paolo Pignatelli June 20, 2025 2 Chapter 1 Foundations and Semantic Constants 1.1 The Information–Observation–Language (I– O–L) Triad Modern knowledge systems reveal a recurring motif: comprehension requires only the differences between two bodies of knowledge, not their entirety. We formalise this with the Information–Observation–Language triad (I, O, L) = (I, O, L), (1.1) where I denotes possible information states, O the set of admissible observa- tions, and L the symbolic language capable of encoding both. Minimal "bridges" between domains are implemented by Local Language Constructors (LLCs), treated in Chapter ??. 1.2 Foundational Postulates Postulate F1 (Semantic locality). Any act of communication factors through a finite sub-language B ⊆ L such that E ⊗ B ∼= L, with E the receiver’s existing language fragment. Postulate F2 (Minimal bridges). Among all such B, natural communica- tion selects one that minimises |B|. Postulate F3 (Hierarchical union). Languages compose by hierarchical union and the semantic density ρ is non-decreasing under this union. 1.3 Semantic Constants We introduce two universal constants: 3 4 CHAPTER 1. FOUNDATIONS AND SEMANTIC CONSTANTS cs the semantic light-speed, bounding information propagation in a knowledge graph: dG(v1, v2) ≤ cs ∆t. (1.2) ℏs the semantic Planck constant, appearing in an uncertainty relation between discovery and invention operators: ∆D ∆I ≥ 1 2ℏs. (1.3) Convenient units set cs =ℏs =1; deviations measure complexity. 1.4 Road-map This chapter establishes notation for the remainder of the book. Chapter ?? develops the geometric view (cs as cone slope), Chapter ?? derives global limits from Eq. (??), Chapter ?? treats drift and masks, and Chapter ?? links the constants to physical information bounds. Take-away. The triad (I, O, L) and constants (cs, ℏs) provide an irreducible substrate on which all higher FIL structures are built. Chapter 2 Semantic Geometry 2.1 Semantic Light-Cones In a knowledge graph G = (V, E) we define the semantic distance dG(v1, v2) as the minimal edge-weighted path length between two concept vertices. Postu- late F1 implies that information flow is bounded by the constant cs introduced in Chapter ??: dG(v1, v2) ≤ cs ∆t. (2.1) Points satisfying equality trace semantic light-cones. They encode the fron- tier beyond which two agents cannot reach mutual comprehension within ∆t. Propagation kernel. Let Kt(v) denote the reachable set from v in time t. A discrete propagator is Pt = ⊮dG≤cst. 2.2 Informational Curvature Light-cone slope alone does not capture semantic gravitation—the tendency of dense subgraphs to attract interpretive trajectories. We introduce an informa- tional curvature tensor K via the deviation of geodesics in G: δ2dG = −K(γ, ˙γ) dσ2. (2.2) Positive curvature corresponds to semantic "mass" and appears near high mutual-information clusters. See [?](§2) for the full derivation. Example – category junction Two dense languages L1, L2 joined by a minimal LLC bridge B create negative curvature in the bridge (saddle) and positive curvature inside each language core. 5 6 CHAPTER 2. SEMANTIC GEOMETRY 2.3 Computational Spacetime Correspondence Mapping Eq. (??) onto a Turing tape with physical delays τ, we recover the computational light-speed bound cs ≈ 1/τ [?]. Informational curvature then corresponds to non-uniform memory access latencies—regions of high semantic mass behave as RAM “black holes”. 2.4 Meta-Law and Quantisation FL_Field Meta-Law postulates a universal action principle in information space. Quantising small oscillations of dG about a ground state yields a discrete spec- trum analogous to normal modes in Riemannian geometry. This motivates the uncertainty relation derived in Eq. (??). Take-away. The geometry of semantic light-cones and informational curva- ture generalises relativistic causality to knowledge systems, setting the stage for global bounds (Chapter ??) and dynamical drift analysis (Chapter ??). 2.5 Voronoi Tessellation and Knowledge Naviga- tion Traditional path-finding on a dense knowledge graph G = (V, E) scales poorly with |V |. To achieve sub-logarithmic query time we partition V into semantic Voronoi cells: Definition 2.1 (Semantic Voronoi Cell). For a seed node s ∈ V the cell Vor(s) is Vor(s) = {v ∈ V | dG(v, s) ≤ dG(v, s′) ∀s′ ̸= s}. Cells tile the graph when seeds form a maximal ϵ-net. The navigation algo- rithm is then: 1. Locate the source and target cells via hashing of node signatures. 2. Traverse the cell adjacency graph (typically O( � |V |) cells). 3. Within the target cell, apply local Djikstra (size ≤ ϵ). Curvature connection. Boundaries between cells coincide with geodesics of informational curvature κ (Section ??). High κ regions produce finer tessella- tions, automatically allocating more seeds where semantic density is high. Drift boundaries. In Chapter ?? drift masks align to cell faces; thus tessel- lation acts as a coarse pre-mask, reducing the dimensionality of drift correction. 2.5. VORONOI TESSELLATION AND KNOWLEDGE NAVIGATION 7 Complexity. With uniform k-nearest-neighbour degree and n seeds the cell adjacency graph has O(n) edges; navigation complexity becomes O(√n + ϵ), sub-logarithmic in |V | for well-chosen n ≈ � |V |. Future work. Investigate hyperbolic Voronoi in negative-curvature regions and probabilistic tessellations where seed membership is fuzzy. 8 CHAPTER 2. SEMANTIC GEOMETRY Chapter 3 Informational Bounds 3.1 Bekenstein-like Entropy Limit for Language The classical Bekenstein bound [?] constrains the maximum entropy S of phys- ical matter in a region of radius R and energy E by S ≤ 2πkER/ℏc. In the FIL setting, tokens carry informational mass and the analogue becomes H(L) ≤ 2π ks EL RL � ℏs, (3.1) where EL is the cumulative energetic cost of storing the language fragment and RL its semantic diameter. Interpretation. If H exceeds this limit, further compression (via LLC bridges) or hierarchical segmentation is required. 3.2 Finite Knowledge Bounds Let G = (V, E) be a directed knowledge graph with path entropy HP and symbol complexity Cs. finiteknowledgebounds2025 derive upper and lower compression bounds |V | log Cs ≤ HP ≤ |E| log Cs. (3.2) We adopt the lower bound as the finite knowledge bound (FKB) for any segment. 3.2.1 Prime-Encoding Lower Bound Prime-encoding of edge labels achieves the lower bound asymptotically; see Appendix ??. 9 10 CHAPTER 3. INFORMATIONAL BOUNDS 3.2.2 Voronoi Capacity Upper Bound Semantic Voronoi cells give a geometric ceiling; we revisit this in Chapter ?? when studying drift fields. 3.3 Acceleration Constraint accelleration2025 show that rapid semantic updates imply an acceleration cost aL ≡ d2H dt2 ≤ c2 s /ℓmin, (3.3) with ℓmin the minimum edge length. This links light-cone slope (cs) to second-order dynamics. 3.4 Big Bang as Information Phase Transition The cosmological Big Bang is recast as a phase transition where H → 0 while dH/dt → ∞. Under FKB this corresponds to the creation of the minimal language fragment required for any subsequent evolution. 3.5 Road-map Informational limits set the stage for Chapter ??, where drift and masks op- erate within these bounds, and Chapter ??, which ties them to particle-level information exchange. Chapter 4 Dynamics, Drift, and Mask-Based Stabilisation 4.1 Diagnosing Semantic Drift Let δk(n) denote the drift magnitude of concept k after n network layers. Follow- ing SSRDraft3, wedefineδk(n) = ∥P n k −P 0 k ∥ ∥P 0 k ∥ , (4.1) where P n k is the perturbation field of concept k at depth n. The shadow depth ∆n k is the first layer m > n such that δk(m) < ε. A rising sequence ∆n k indicates unstable semantics. 4.2 Mask Evolution Operator Dynamic masks M n k are injected at layer n to probe drift. The Mask Evolution Operator (MEO) propagates masks across depth: T n 1 : M 1 k �−→ M n k , T n 1 = T n n−1 ◦ · · · ◦ T 2 1 . (4.2) The error tensor En k = M n k − T n 1 (M 1 k) (4.3) serves as a drift-diagnostic: ∥En k ∥ → 0 implies layer stability. 4.3 Gaussian-Mixture View of Observation Observation tokens are embedded as weighted Gaussian mixtures GMM(wi, µi, Σi). Overlap of components predicts hallucination regions. The mixture distance in- troduces a probabilistic refinement of the drift metric: dGMM(p, q) = 1 − � i � w(p) i w(q) i e− 1 2 ∆µT i Σ−1 i ∆µi. (4.4) 11 12CHAPTER 4. DYNAMICS, DRIFT, AND MASK-BASED STABILISATION 4.4 Perturbation Cellular Automata Discrete propagation of truth-wavefronts may be simulated by a perturbation cellular automaton (PCA) on the concept graph G = (V, E). Each cell updates via st+1(v) = f � st(v), (st(u))u∈N(v) � , (4.5) where f conserves a local semantic energy to satisfy the bound dG ≤ cs∆t. 4.5 The Nibbler Algorithm 1. Initialise discovery state D0 and pattern set P0. 2. (Discovery) Dt+1 ← Dt + NibblerStep(Dt). 3. (Pattern) Pt+1 ← MetaPattern(Pt, Dt+1). 4. Repeat until ∆D and ∆P fall below thresholds. The interface kernel kNI(x, y) = αkD(x, y) + (1 − α)kP (x, y) (4.6) controls the discovery–pattern balance. 4.6 Integration with the UIL Framework IntegrationUILextendthegraphmodeltoincludeconfidencec(ω) and security λ(ω). The drift-aware propagation rule becomes ∆(vi, vi+1) = min � info change | λ(vi+1) ≥ λmin, c(ω) ≥ cmin � . (4.7) 4.7 Outlook This chapter introduced dynamical machinery that preserves the semantic con- stants while allowing adaptive evolution. Chapter ?? maps these operators to physical processes—e.g. interferometric stabilisation in the InterferoShell. Take-away. Mask evolution, GMM observation, and Nibbler search conspire to keep drift bounded without violating the informational limits of Chapter ??. Chapter 5 Physical and Computational Correspondence 5.1 Particles as Information Events Each fundamental interaction instantiates new information[?]. Let S(t) = {pi, Eij} denote the quantum state at time t. A collision T : S(t) → S(t + 1) increases the descriptive complexity ∆I = I � S(t + 1) � − I � S(t) � ≤ kE. (5.1) This yields a conservation-of-information principle analogous to energy conser- vation in QFT. 5.2 Computational Relativity Analogy 5.2.1 Complexity vs. Time-Dilation Landauer–Bremermann bounds suggest that executing N logical operations on mass m requires a minimum proper time ∆τ ≥ Nℏ/(mc2). Interpreting com- plexity as curvature we obtain a metric on algorithmic spacetime: ds2 = − � 1 − 2G C c2r � c2dt2 + � 1 − 2G C c2r �−1 dr2 + r2dΩ2, (5.2) with C the local Kolmogorov-complexity density. 5.2.2 Physical Foundations of Computational Light-Speed Chapter 3 of [?] derives a physical upper speed of algorithmic propagation that matches the semantic constant cs from Chapter ??. 13 14CHAPTER 5. PHYSICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL CORRESPONDENCE 5.3 Computational Spacetime Geometry Information flow defines a causal set C whose Hasse diagram embeds into the knowledge graph G. Curvature of C matches informational curvature κ of Sec- tion ??, closing the semantic-physical loop. 5.4 Prime Path Encoding for Graph Compres- sion Path-encoding maps concept trajectories to unique prime products π(P) = � pni i . The path length satisfies |P| ≤ O � log π(P) � , (5.3) providing asymptotically optimal storage[?]. 5.5 Discussion and Future Work Links between semantic and physical bounds suggest experimental tests: 1. Measure algorithmic time-dilation effects in high-complexity quantum cir- cuits. 2. Investigate Hawking-like emission at semantic black-hole horizons where ρ → ∞. 3. Extend computational-relativity metrics to non-commutative graph ge- ometries. Take-away. Physical interaction, algorithmic complexity, and semantic struc- ture obey the same limiting principles, unifying FIL with foundational physics.
