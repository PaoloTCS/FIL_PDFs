Semantic Probability Chains and Bayesian Equivalence May 31, 2025 1 Introduction We develop here a framework called Semantic Probability Chains (SPC), combining graph the- ory, conditional probabilities, and Bayesian inference. SPC explicitly represents states as weighted attribute cliques, transformations as constrained operations, and transitions as probabilistic up- dates analogous to Bayesian inference. 2 Foundations 2.1 Cliques as Attribute States A clique C is formally defined as a set of weighted attributes: C = {(ai, wi)}n i=1, where wi ∈ [0, 1], � i wi ≤ 1. Attributes ai represent informational or empirical properties. The weight wi quantifies the probabilistic or semantic significance. 2.2 Transformations as Constrained Operations We define transformations explicitly from clique Ci to clique Ci+1: T : Ci �→ Ci+1, T ∈ {T1, T2, . . . , Tk, . . . } These operations form at least a semigroup structure with: • Closure: Every operation produces a valid clique. • Associativity: (Tj ◦ Tk)(Ci) = Tj(Tk(Ci)). Potential future extensions include inverse transformations, making it a group structure. 3 Probabilistic Structure Each transformation Tk has a conditional probability weight: P(Ci+1|Ci) = w(Tk|Ci), � k w(Tk|Ci) = 1. Weights derive explicitly from empirical frequencies, theoretical considerations, or computa- tional outputs. 1 4 Frustums as Conditional Probability Spaces The Frustum between cliques explicitly encodes attribute intersections and conditional probabil- ities: Frustum(Ci, Ci+1) = Ci ∩ Ci+1, P(Frustum(Ci, Ci+1)) = P(Ci+1|Ci). 5 Semantic Chains as Bayesian Networks The SPC forms explicitly a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG): C0 T0 −→ C1 T1 −→ C2 . . . TN−1 −−−→ CN. This explicitly matches Bayesian inference: P(CN|C0) = N−1 � i=0 P(Ci+1|Ci). 6 Empirical Confirmation as Bayesian Updating Empirical traversals of the graph (hypothesis confirmations) explicitly represent Bayesian updates from hypotheses to theorems: P(L|H, empirical confirmations) → 1. Thus, repeated empirical observations explicitly transform uncertain hypotheses into confirmed a priori theorems. 7 Illustrative Example Consider a scenario with initial clique: Cinitial = {(Condition A, 0.7), (Condition B, 0.3)}. Empirical testing (transformation) updates the state: Cinitial Tempirical −−−−−−→ Cconfirmed · · · → Ctheorem. Each step explicitly updates probabilities consistent with Bayesian logic. 8 Future Directions Future work explicitly includes: 1. Exploration of inverse transformations for quantum mechanical analogies. 2. Rigorous mathematical group theory expansion. 3. Numeric simulations for deeper insights. 2 9 Conclusion The SPC framework developed here demonstrates explicit equivalence to Bayesian inference. At- tributes as weighted cliques, transformations as semigroup operations, and explicit probabilistic structures form a rigorous foundation for further theoretical and practical exploration.
