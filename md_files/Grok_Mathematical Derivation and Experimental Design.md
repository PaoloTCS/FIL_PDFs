Excellent. Let's proceed. This is where the theory confronts reality and rigor. We will tackle these two critical next steps in parallel.

Below, I will outline:
1.  A proposed path for the **Rigorous Mathematical Derivation** of the pseudo-Riemannian metric.
2.  A detailed **Experimental Design** for validating the core prediction of computational light cones.

### Part 1: Rigorous Mathematical Derivation of the Metric `g_μν`

The central challenge is to derive a metric with a mixed signature (`+`, `-`, `-`, `-`) from the foundational principles of the Influence (`Φ`) and Perturbability (`Π`) fields, in a way that naturally reflects the Discovery/Invention dichotomy.

Here is a proposed line of reasoning.

#### **Objective:**
To derive the computational metric tensor `g_μν` such that `ds² = g_μν dx^μ dx^ν` is positive for timelike ("Discovery") paths and negative for spacelike ("Invention") paths.

#### **Postulate 1: The Primacy of the Causal Interval**
We postulate that the fundamental spacetime interval `ds²` in computational spacetime is composed of two distinct components: a temporal (causal) part and a spatial (transformational) part.
`ds² = (dτ_comp)² - (dl_comp)²`

*   `(dτ_comp)²`: Represents the square of the infinitesimal advance in **computational proper time**. This corresponds to a step in a logical, causal sequence—a "Discovery."
*   `(dl_comp)²`: Represents the square of the infinitesimal distance in **pattern space**. This corresponds to the "difficulty" or "resistance" of transforming one pattern into another.

This postulate immediately introduces the pseudo-Riemannian structure. The task now is to define `dτ_comp` and `dl_comp` in terms of the underlying fields.

#### **Step 2: Defining the Spatial Component `dl_comp`**
The "Observational Influence Fields" paper provides the key. We defined the distance between two states as the integral over the path of highest "Perturbability" (`Π`). This implies that the local resistance to movement is inversely related to `Π`.

*   Let the coordinates in hierarchical pattern space be `x^i` (e.g., token position, semantic embedding dimensions).
*   The line element `dl_comp` in this space is defined by a Riemannian metric `h_ij`.
*   We propose that this metric is directly determined by the Perturbability field:
    `dl_comp² = h_ij dx^i dx^j`, where `h_ij(x,t) = [Π(x,t)]⁻² δ_ij` (for an isotropic space).
*   The `Π⁻²` term means that moving through regions of high perturbability (low resistance) costs little "distance," aligning with the definition of a geodesic as a path of highest `Π`.

#### **Step 3: Defining the Temporal Component `dτ_comp`**
The computational proper time `τ_comp` must represent the progression of a causal chain. This should be linked to the accumulation of *influence* itself, as described by the `Φ` field. A step forward in causal time means a new state has been influenced by a prior one.

*   Let the coordinate representing the causal sequence be `x⁰ = t_comp` (e.g., layer depth in a transformer, a discrete time step).
*   We propose that the proper time interval is proportional to the change in the influence field `Φ` along the causal path.
    `(dτ_comp)² = g₀₀ (dx⁰)²`, where `g₀₀(x,t) = k [Φ(x,t)]²`
*   The `Φ²` term signifies that regions of high influence are "causally dense"—a step in such a region corresponds to a large advance in proper time. The constant `k` relates the magnitude of the influence field to the units of time.

#### **Step 4: Assembling the Full Metric `g_μν`**
Combining these steps gives us the full metric tensor for a simple, non-rotating system (off-diagonal terms are zero):

*   `g₀₀ = k [Φ(x,t)]²`
*   `g_ij = -[Π(x,t)]⁻² δ_ij`
*   `g_μν = diag(kΦ², -Π⁻², -Π⁻², ...)`

The full interval is: `ds² = k[Φ]²(dx⁰)² - [Π]⁻²(dx^i)²`

#### **Step 5: Verifying the Discovery/Invention Split**

*   **Discovery (Timelike Path):** A discovery is a continuous causal process. At each step, the system moves to a nearby point in pattern space (`dl_comp` is small) that is strongly influenced by the previous step (`Φ` is high, so `dτ_comp` is large). This ensures `(dτ_comp)² > (dl_comp)²`, making `ds² > 0`. The path follows a "trough" of high influence.
*   **Invention (Spacelike Path):** An invention is a leap to a new, previously un-influenced region of pattern space. This requires traversing a large distance in pattern space (`dl_comp` is large) across a region where the influence from the starting point is near zero (`Φ` is low, so `dτ_comp` is small or zero). This ensures `(dτ_comp)² < (dl_comp)²`, making `ds² < 0`. This is a jump across a causal void.

This completes a plausible derivation. The next step would be to rigorously prove the self-consistency of this metric with the proposed field equations.

### Part 2: Experimental Design: Transformer Light Cone Detection

This is the primary experiment to find the first empirical evidence for the theory.

#### **Hypothesis**
The propagation of influence from a single input token through the layers of a Transformer model is not instantaneous or chaotic. It is bounded by a maximum speed (`c_comp`), creating a cone-like causal structure in `(layer, token)` space.

#### **Apparatus**
1.  **Model:** GPT-2 Small (117M parameters). It is a well-documented, standard transformer architecture.
2.  **Software:** PyTorch or TensorFlow.
3.  **Tools:** Custom hooks to capture hidden state activations at every layer for every token.

#### **Methodology**

**Phase 1: Baseline Measurement**
1.  **Input:** A simple sentence with a masked token. `Input = "The cat sat on the [MASK]"`
2.  **Execution:** Perform a single forward pass of the model.
3.  **Record:**
    *   `A_baseline(l, t)`: The activation vector for every token `t` at every layer `l`.
    *   `Logits_baseline`: The final output probability distribution over the vocabulary for the `[MASK]` token.

**Phase 2: Perturbation Protocol**
1.  **Select Target:** Choose a single token to perturb. Let's choose the first token, `t_p = 0` ("The").
2.  **Perturb:** Modify the input embedding of the target token. `Embedding_perturbed(t_p) = Embedding_baseline(t_p) + ε`, where `ε` is a small, fixed noise vector (e.g., from a Gaussian distribution).
3.  **Execution:** Perform a new forward pass with the perturbed embedding.
4.  **Record:**
    *   `A_perturbed(l, t)`: The new set of activations.
    *   `Logits_perturbed`: The new final output logits for the `[MASK]` token.

**Phase 3: Influence Calculation**
1.  **Define Influence Function:** We need to quantify how much the perturbation of token `t_p` at the input layer affected the final prediction. A robust metric is the L2-norm (Euclidean distance) of the change in the final logits.
    `Influence(t_p) = ||Logits_perturbed - Logits_baseline||₂`
2.  **Refined Influence:** To map the cone, we need to see how the perturbation at `t_p` affects *intermediate* tokens at *intermediate* layers. We can measure the change in the activation of token `t` at layer `l` due to the initial perturbation.
    `Influence(l, t | t_p) = ||A_perturbed(l, t) - A_baseline(l, t)||₂`

**Phase 4: Visualization & Analysis**
1.  **Plotting:** Create a 3D surface plot:
    *   **X-axis:** Layer number `l` (Computational Time)
    *   **Y-axis:** Token position `t` (Computational Space)
    *   **Z-axis:** Influence `Influence(l, t | t_p)`
2.  **Analysis:** Examine the shape of the resulting surface.

#### **Expected Result**
The plot will show a cone-shaped ridge.
*   At `l=0`, the influence is a sharp spike at `t = t_p` and zero elsewhere.
*   As `l` increases, the influence will spread to adjacent tokens (`t_p-1`, `t_p+1`, etc.).
*   The spread will be **bounded**. The "width" of the influence ridge will grow linearly with the layer depth `l`.
*   The slope of the cone's boundary gives us our first experimental measurement of the **computational speed limit, `c_comp`**.

#### **Control Tests (Crucial for Falsification)**

1.  **RNN Control:** Repeat the experiment on a standard RNN/LSTM. The expected result is a very narrow "world-line," not a cone, as information is processed strictly sequentially.
2.  **CNN Control:** Repeat on a standard CNN. The result should be a perfectly sharp, rigid cone defined by the kernel size and dilation factor.
3.  **Attention Bypass:** Manually create a modified transformer with extra residual connections that skip multiple layers. Test if this "wormhole" allows influence to propagate faster than `c_comp`, which would challenge the theory.

This experimental design provides a clear, falsifiable test of the central prediction of the Computational Relativity framework. A positive result would be a major validation.
