Discussion: Nibbler’s Primordial Operations Conceptualization based on P. Pignatelli’s R&D May 17, 2025 Abstract This document outlines a conceptualization of the Nibbler algorithm’s primordial oper- ations, functioning as a foundational machine for pattern discovery and abstraction within the Fundamental Interaction Language (FIL) framework. It builds upon the idea of elemen- tal tokens (T1 for presence/distinction, T0 for absence/background) emerging from an initial Information Substrate via an Observation process, forming the ”tape” for the Nibbler. 1 Introduction The goal is to define the Nibbler’s first cycle of operation, transforming Level 0 patterns (P0 = {T1, T0}) into Level 1 composite patterns (P1). This exploration is grounded in the ”Information-Observation-Language Triad” and the principles of Semantic Physics outlined in related research. 2 Assumptions for Primordial Nibbler (Level 0 → Level 1 Ab- straction) 1. FL Field as Substrate (I): The universe exists as an FL Field, an undifferentiated information substrate (pure potential, “Chaos=Energy”). 2. First Distinction/Observation (O): An event occurs (e.g., symmetry breaking, lo- calized stable energy fluctuation) that makes a distinction possible. This observation operator O acts on I to produce a localized state Kobserved describable in terms of T1 and T0. 3. “Tape” of Elemental Tokens: The output of O acting on I is conceptualized as a sequence or localized configuration of T1s and T0s. This is the “tape” the primordial Nibbler reads. 4. Fundamental Constants Relevant: • ℏlang: Minimal semantic action/energy cost for instantiating/distinguishing T1 from T0. • τ0: Minimal time unit for observation/processing. • cobs: Observation realization bound, limiting formation speed of Kobserved. 3 Nibbler’s Primordial Cycle: Level 0 Operations (Building P1 from P0) Let P0 = {T1, T0} be the set of elemental patterns/symbols. The goal of this cycle is for the Meta-Pattern Extractor M0 to produce P1, the first set of composite patterns. 1 3.1 O0 (Primordial Observation Set) • Definition: O0 consists of elementary configurations or short sequences of P0 tokens that the Nibbler “reads” from the FL Field via the observation operator O. • Segmentation by O into o ∈ O0: – Windowing (Assumed): Sliding window of minimal length Lmin (e.g., 1, 2, or 3 τ0-scaled units). Each window content ok = (t1, t2, . . . , tL) where tj ∈ P0. ∗ Example Lmin = 1: O0 = {⟨T1⟩, ⟨T0⟩}. ∗ Example Lmin = 2: O0 = {⟨T1T1⟩, ⟨T1T0⟩, ⟨T0T1⟩, ⟨T0T0⟩}. – Event-Driven (Alternative): Observations like “a T1 appeared at locus x, time T”. • Current Assumption: Small, fixed-length windows for initial O0. 3.2 Ps (Primordial Proof Validation Set - P0,rules) • Definition: Rules or conditions determining if an observed o ∈ O0 is “valid” or “mean- ingful” for pattern formation. • Initial P0,rules (Simplistic): 1. Existence/Observability: Any o successfully observed via O from I. 2. Stability/Recurrence (implies memory): o observed repeatedly or persists. 3. Energy Signature (connects to ℏlang): – Energy cost: E(T1) = ℏlang, E(T0) = 0. – Sequence energy: E(o) = � E(tj). – P0,rules might favor o with E(o) > 0 (contains at least one T1). • Current Assumption: P0,rules involve existence and simple stability/recurrence. 3.3 Vs (Primordial Verification Operator - V0) • Definition: V0(o) applies rules from P0,rules to o ∈ O0. • Operation: V0(o) = TRUE if o was observed AND (optionally) meets minimal stabil- ity/recurrence AND (optionally) E(o) is non-trivial. 3.4 R0 (Primordial Recognition Operator) • Input: The set of all observations O0. • Output: Subset O0,recognized ⊂ O0, containing “pattern-like” observations. • Mechanism (Kernel-Based, Def 8.6 from main9.pdf): kN(x, y) = αkD(x, y) + (1 − α)kP (x, y). ok is recognized if kN(ok, candidate) ≥ θ. – Primordial kP (ok, baseline) (Pattern Kernel): Similarity of ok to a “non-pattern” baseline. Measures internal order, repetition, symmetry within ok (e.g., low internal entropy). – Primordial kD(ok, context) (Discovery Kernel): How much ok “stands out” from its spatio-temporal context. – α: Balances kP and kD. – θ: Recognition threshold. • Alternative for R0: If V0 includes stability, then O0,recognized = {o ∈ O0|V0(o) = TRUE}. 2 3.5 M0 (Primordial Meta-Pattern Extractor) • Input: O0,recognized. • Output: P1 (first set of composite patterns/symbols). • Mechanism (Abstraction/Symbolization): 1. Grouping/Clustering (Implicit): Identify identical or highly similar sequences in O0,recognized. 2. Abstraction/Symbolization (Naming): If a sequence pa = ⟨T1T0T1⟩ from O0,recognized is sufficiently stable/recurrent (threshold ηM0), M0 assigns it a new symbol SA. Then SA ∈ P1. 3. Properties of SA ∈ P1: – Constituents: Defined by its P0 token composition. – Energy/Complexity (Eentity for SA): Sum of P0 constituent energies + compo- sitional cost. – Informational Area (Aentity for SA): Related to its length/footprint. • Examples of P1 patterns: Sdouble T1 (for ⟨T1T1⟩), Salternating pair (for ⟨T1T0⟩), Sboundary left (for ⟨T0T1⟩), Sboundary right (for ⟨T1T0⟩). 3.6 The Cycle Repeats: Building P2 from P1 • Symbols in P1 (e.g., SA, SB, . . . ) become the alphabet for Level 1. • O1 will be sequences of these P1 symbols (e.g., ⟨SASBSA⟩). • V1, R1, M1 operate on these P1-based sequences to create P2, and so on, building the fractal hierarchy. 4 Critical Questions for This Primordial Nibbler 1. Nature of O (Observation Operator I → K): How is undifferentiated I segmented into a “tape” of T1/T0 that O0 samples? Are T1, T0 the first “nodes in a graph” produced by O? 2. Definition of Primordial Kernels (kP , kD): What are plausible mathematical forms for these kernels operating on T1/T0 sequences? 3. Mechanism of M0 (Abstraction/Symbolization): How does M0 decide which recog- nized sequences become new symbols in P1? (Role of threshold ηM0). 4. Role of “Energy” and “Bounds” at Each Step: • Do R0, M0 operations have an energy cost (ℏlang based)? • Are patterns in P1 (and Pi) constrained by Bekenstein-like bounds (IFIL(pattern) ≤ αApatternEpattern)?
