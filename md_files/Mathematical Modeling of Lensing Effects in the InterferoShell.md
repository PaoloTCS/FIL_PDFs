Mathematical Modeling of Lensing Effects in the InterferoShell Paolo Pignatelli and Anthropic Opus 4 1 Introduction This document develops the complete mathematical framework for gravitational lensing effects in the InterferoShell system, connecting the physical interference patterns to com- putational geometry principles from our FIL framework. 2 Fundamental Field Equations 2.1 Emitter Field Distribution Each emitter on the spherical shell at position ˆri = (θi, ϕi) generates a field: Ei(r, t) = Ai exp[i(k · r − ωit + ψi)]Y mi ψi (θ, ϕ) (1) Where: • Ai: Amplitude (encodes information magnitude) • ωi: Frequency (can encode information channels) • ψi: Phase (primary information carrier) • Y mi ψi : Spherical harmonic mode 1 2.2 Total Field Superposition The total field at any point is: Etotal(r, t) = � i Ei(r, t) × G(r, ri) (2) Where G(r, ri) is the Green’s function modified by the local information density. 3 Information Density and Refractive Index 3.1 Local Information Density The information density at position r is: ρinfo(r) = |Etotal(r)|2 4πεinfo (3) Where εinfo is the “information permittivity” of the substrate. 3.2 Density-Dependent Refractive Index Following our computational relativity framework: n(r) = n0 [1 + β · ρinfo(r)] (4) This creates a spatially varying refractive index analogous to gravitational potential: n(r) = n0 � 1 + 2Φcomp(r) c2 comp � (5) Where Φcomp is the computational potential. 2 4 Ray Optics in the InterferoShell 4.1 Eikonal Equation In the high-frequency limit, field propagation follows: |∇S|2 = n2(r) (6) Where S is the phase function (eikonal). 4.2 Ray Trajectories Light rays follow geodesics in the effective metric: d2xµ dλ2 + Γµ νρ dxν dλ dxρ dλ = 0 (7) Where the Christoffel symbols arise from the gradient of n(r): Γµ νρ = 1 2ngµσ � ∂νnδσ ρ + ∂ρnδσ ν − ∂σngνρ � (8) 5 Lensing Equation for the InterferoShell 5.1 Deflection Angle For a ray passing through the shell with impact parameter b: ˆα = − 2 c2 comp � ∇⊥Φcomp dl (9) Where ∇⊥ is the gradient perpendicular to the unperturbed ray. 3 5.2 InterferoShell Lens Equation Mapping source position β to image position θ: β = θ − α(θ) (10) Where the deflection angle depends on the integrated density: α(θ) = 1 π �� d2θ′ κ(θ′) θ − θ′ |θ − θ′|2 (11) 5.3 Convergence (Focusing Power) The convergence κ represents the focusing strength: κ(θ) = Σinfo(θ) Σcrit (12) Where: • Σinfo: Projected information density • Σcrit: Critical density for strong lensing 6 Wave Optics Treatment 6.1 Kirchhoff Integral For coherent fields, we must use wave optics: E(robs) = i λ �� aperture E(r′)exp(ikR) R × F(θ) dA′ (13) Where F(θ) is the obliquity factor. 4 6.2 Fresnel Approximation Near the focal region: E(x, y, z) = exp(ikz) iλz �� E(ξ, η) exp � ik 2z � (x − ξ)2 + (y − η)2�� dξdη (14) Modified by the phase distortion from lensing: Φlens(ξ, η) = 2π λ � [n(path) − n0] dl (15) 7 Spherical Harmonic Decomposition 7.1 Field Expansion Expand the field in spherical harmonics: E(θ, ϕ, r) = ∞ � ℓ=0 ℓ � m=−ℓ aℓm(r)Y m ℓ (θ, ϕ) (16) 7.2 Lensing in Harmonic Space The lensing operation becomes: a′ ℓm = � ℓ′m′ Lℓm,ℓ′m′aℓ′m′ (17) Where L is the lensing operator in harmonic space: Lℓm,ℓ′m′ = �� Y m∗ ℓ (θ, ϕ)Glens(θ, ϕ; θ′, ϕ′)Y m′ ℓ′ (θ′, ϕ′) dΩ dΩ′ (18) 5 8 Caustics and Critical Curves 8.1 Critical Curves Critical curves occur where the Jacobian vanishes: det �∂β ∂θ � = det � I − ∂α ∂θ � = 0 (19) Leading to: (1 − κ)2 − |γ|2 = 0 (20) Where γ is the shear. 8.2 Caustic Classification InterferoShell caustics follow the standard ADE classification: • A2: Fold caustic (linear focusing) • A3: Cusp caustic (point focus) • D4: Swallowtail (complex interference) 9 Time-Dependent Lensing 9.1 Dynamic Density Evolution Information density evolves according to: ∂ρinfo ∂t + ∇ · (ρinfovinfo) = Sinfo (21) Where vinfo is the information flow velocity and Sinfo is the source term. 6 9.2 Adaptive Lensing The lensing strength evolves as: ∂κ ∂t = 1 Σcrit �∂Σinfo ∂t � (22) Creating a feedback loop: Field pattern → Density → Lensing → New field pattern 10 Matrix Operations via Lensing 10.1 Linear Transformation A matrix multiplication Mv can be encoded as: Eout = L[Ein] (23) Where the lensing operator L implements: Lij = exp(iΦij) × Tij (24) • Φij: Phase encoding matrix elements • Tij: Transmission amplitude 10.2 2×2 Matrix Example For a 2×2 matrix multiplication:   a11 a12 a21 a22     v1 v2   =   Eout,1 Eout,2   (25) 7 Implemented as: • Four emitters encode aij as phases • Two input beams encode v1, v2 • Interference at two detection points yields output 11 Connection to Computational Relativity 11.1 Metric Correspondence The InterferoShell metric in information space: ds2 = c2 compdt2 − n2(r) � dr2 + r2(dθ2 + sin2 θ dϕ2) � (26) Where n(r) varies with information density. 11.2 Temperature Scaling Following our ccomp(T) derivation: neff(T) = n0 � 1 + ρinfo · kBT ln(2) πℏ � (27) Higher temperature → stronger lensing effects. 12 Experimental Signatures 12.1 Observable Quantities • Ring formation: θEinstein = � 4πGcompMinfo c2 comp (28) 8 • Multiple images: Nimages = 2 �κmax κcrit � + 1 (29) • Time delays: ∆t = 1 ccomp · ∆Φlens (30) • Magnification: µ = 1 ��det � ∂β ∂θ ��� (31) 12.2 Feedback Oscillations Self-consistent solutions satisfy: ρinfo[E] = ρinfo[L(E, ρinfo)] (32) Leading to potential oscillatory or chaotic dynamics. 13 Optimization Principles 13.1 Variational Formulation The field configuration minimizes: S = ��� �1 2|E|2 − V (ρinfo) � dV dt (33) Where V (ρinfo) is the information potential. 13.2 Geodesic Computation Optimal computation paths follow geodesics: δ � n(s) ds = 0 (34) 9 Naturally implementing Local Language Constructor principles. 14 Summary The InterferoShell exhibits rich lensing phenomena arising from: • Density-dependent propagation creating effective curvature • Coherent interference enabling wave-optical effects • Spherical geometry providing natural focusing • Feedback dynamics allowing adaptive computation • Matrix encoding through phase relationships This framework unifies: • Physical optics (Maxwell equations) • Computational geometry (FIL framework) • Information theory (Shannon limits) • General relativity (lensing equations) The mathematical structure reveals that the InterferoShell is not merely analogous to grav- itational lensing—it implements a genuine curved information spacetime where compu- tation bends the effective geometry of information flow.
