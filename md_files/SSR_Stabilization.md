Semantic Shadow Reconstruction for AI Stabilization Paolo Pignatelli 2025-05-01 Contents 1 1 Introduction Semantic instability in large language models (LLMs), such as hallucinations and sensitiv- ity to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, hinders their deployment in critical applications like therapeutic AI (?) and cross-domain knowledge integration (?). Semantic Shadow Recon- struction (SSR) addresses this by modeling semantic drift as a geometric phenomenon on a high-dimensional information manifold, stabilized through dynamic masking, truth an- choring, and a Mask Controller Network (MCN). Inspired by foundational theories like the Fundamental Interaction Language (FIL) (?), SSR offers a closed-loop system for robust AI. This paper presents SSR’s computational framework, introduces the Semantic Double- Slit Framework as a physics-inspired analogy, and validates both through Dynamic Func- tional Mapping (DFM), which discovers emergent functional categories. Our contributions include: • A geometric approach to semantic drift using structured masking. • A physics-inspired double-slit model for token processing. • DFM as an empirical method, with synthetic and proposed experiments. • Integration with theoretical frameworks like FIL (?). This work complements therapeutic applications (?) and theoretical foundations (?), form- ing a cohesive research program. 2 Background and Related Work Semantic drift arises from unstable representations in high-dimensional embedding spaces (?). Dropout (?), adversarial training (?), and knowledge distillation (?) mitigate instability but lack semantic precision. Attention mechanisms (?) inspire SSR’s dynamic masking, while truth anchoring echoes cognitive grounding (?). The Semantic Double-Slit Framework draws on quantum analogies, similar to ?, fram- ing tokens as information quanta. DFM extends interpretability methods (?) by focusing on emergent categories, aligning with FIL’s cross-domain hypotheses (?). Your Nibbler Al- gorithm (April 14, 2025) informs DFM’s hierarchical clustering, enhancing pattern recogni- tion. 3 Semantic Shadow Reconstruction Framework SSR stabilizes neural networks by controlling semantic drift through a closed-loop system. 3.1 Geometric View of Semantic Drift Activations in a model f with layers L1, . . . , LN form a manifold. Drift is measured as: δm k = ∥fmasked Lm − fclean Lm ∥2, where fLm(x) is the output at layer Lm for input x. Drift dynamics are captured by ∆δ = δm k+1 − δm k and ∆2δ. 2 3.2 Dynamic Masking Sparse masks Mn k ∈ {0, 1}dn are applied at layer Ln: fmasked Lm (x) = fLm(x ⊙ Mn k ). Masks are structured to probe semantic features, unlike random dropout. For example, masking high-magnitude activations in a Transformer’s feed-forward layer highlights key tokens. 3.3 Mask Controller Network (MCN) The MCN, an LSTM-based network, generates masks Mk+1 to minimize: LMCN = E[∥δm k ∥2 2]. It processes drift history (δ, ∆δ, ∆2δ), adapting masks dynamically, inspired by your Nibbler Algorithm’s hierarchical control. 3.4 Truth Anchoring Truth anchors Ti (e.g., factual statements) define stable points. Wavefronts W(x) are: W(x) = � i exp � −d(Ti, x)2 2σ2 � . The loss is: Lanchor = � x ∥δ(x) − W(x)∥2 2. The gradient ∇MLanchor guides MCN updates. 3.5 Role-Conditioned Masks Masks Mn,r k = Pr ⊙ Mn k target roles r ∈ {N, V, Adj, . . . } via operator ˆR. Drift is: δr(x) = ∥fmasked(r) Lm (x) − fclean Lm (x)∥2. This probes emergent linguistic categories, linking to ?’s proto-semantic clusters. 4 Semantic Double-Slit Framework Building on SSR’s masking, we propose a quantum-inspired model where tokens traverse a dynamic mask, producing interference patterns in the next layer’s activation field. 3 x y Blob Shadow Projection Semantic Manifold Figure 1: Blob ↔ Shadow projection on the semantic manifold. 4.1 System Mapping Tokens are “information quanta,” with the mask M as a double-slit barrier: Quantum Double-Slit Neural Information Flow Photons Tokens/embeddings Slits Dynamic mask M Screen Activation field A Which-path detection Hard attention Wavefunction collapse Weight update 4.2 Formal Representation The semantic wavefunction ψ(tag) tok (x) for a token with tag tag ∈ {N, V, Adj, . . . } is transformed by: ψ′ tok(x) = M(t, c)ψ(tag) tok (x). Soft masking preserves superposition, while hard masking induces collapse. Tag-dependent scattering is: M � ψ(N) tok + ψ(V) tok � ̸= Mψ(N) tok + Mψ(V) tok. 4.3 Interference Pattern The activation field is: A(x) = � tok |ψ′ tok(x)|2, showing interference based on M’s phase shifts. 4.4 Perturbation Field The perturbative response is: δA(j,τ,σ) i = A(masked) i − A(baseline) i . This field reveals tag-specific coupling, grounding linguistic categories. 4 4.5 Proposed Experiments 1. Soft vs. Hard Masking: Measure A’s variance as masking shifts from soft to hard. 2. Tag-Modulated Scattering: Inject noun/verb tokens and analyze δAi statistics. 3. Which-Path Erasure: Use reversible masks to test interference recovery.

Perturbation: Apply SSR masks to Ln units. 2. Measurement: Record profiles (δ at Lm, loss changes). 3. Clustering: Use k-means with Nibbler-inspired hierarchy. 4. Characterization: Correlate clusters with input features. 5.2 NLP Experiment Setup: BERT on MLM, perturb L6, measure δ at L11. • Perturbation: Mask groups of 10 units. • Profile: (δPCA, ∆Loss) over 1000 sentences. • Clustering: K-means, k = 5. • Results: Synthetic clusters show C0 (verbs), C1 (nouns) (Table ??).

DFM’s cross-domain potential, linked to FIL (?), suggests broader applications. 8 Conclusion SSR and DFM advance AI stabilization, with the double-slit framework providing a novel theoretical lens.
