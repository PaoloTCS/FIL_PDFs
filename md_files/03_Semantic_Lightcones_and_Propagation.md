# 03 Semantic Lightcones and Propagation

Semantic Lightcones and Propagation Limits In this section, we define the concept of semantic lightcones—regions of causal influence in a semantic knowledge graph. This extends the relativistic concept of a lightcone into the domain of inference, belief propagation, and semantic reachability. 1. Semantic Distance and Causal Structure Let G = (V, E) be a directed knowledge graph, where V are knowledge nodes (observations, beliefs, facts) and E are transformations (proof steps, inferences, semantic transitions). We define the semantic distance dsem(vi, vj) as the minimal weighted path length from node vi to node vj under valid transformation rules. These rules preserve semantic coherence and may include context-dependent constraints. A node vj is said to be semantically reachable from vi if there exists a valid path: P = {vi → · · · → vj} with total cost dsem(vi, vj) < ∞ 2. Definition of the Semantic Lightcone We define the forward semantic lightcone of a node v as: C+(v, t) = {u ∈ V : dsem(v, u) ≤ csem · t} and the backward lightcone as: C−(v, t) = {u ∈ V : dsem(u, v) ≤ csem · t} This defines the region of semantic space that can be influenced by (or influence) node v within propagation time t, assuming csem is the maximal semantic propagation speed. 3. Semantic Causality and Isolation If vj /∈ C+(vi, t) for any finite t, then vj is semantically causally disconnected from vi. This provides a test for: • Semantic irrelevance • Topic drift beyond recoverability • Logical disconnection or contradiction 4. Observation Delays and Cone Asymmetry Observation introduces delay due to finite resolution and processing latency. Thus: C+ obs(v, t) ⊆ C+(v, t) The true region in which semantic influence has been realized is strictly smaller than the potential causal region. This allows us to define drift zones: D(v, t) = C+(v, t) \ C+ obs(v, t) which encode zones of unreconciled knowledge flow. 1 5. Implications for System Design • In AI systems: limits update diffusion and knowledge coherence. • In human cognition: defines what can be recalled or referenced coherently. • In epistemology: introduces a formal limit on semantic influence. Future work includes defining field equations over lightcones, and integrating the structure into predictive graph traversals and loss functions.
