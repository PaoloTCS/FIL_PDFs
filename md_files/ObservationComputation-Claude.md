Mathematical Theory of Observational Influence Fields: From Big Bang Perturbations to Semantic Cellular Automata Paolo Pignatelli June 14, 2025 Abstract We develop a comprehensive mathematical framework for observational influence fields, establishing observations as the fundamental building blocks of semantic space. Starting from the primordial observation at the Big Bang, we construct a field theory where observa- tions create perturbation fields that govern probability, semantic distance, and information propagation. The theory is implemented through observation-based cellular automata with explicit computational rules. This work provides the mathematical foundation for the Fun- damental Interaction Language (FIL) framework and its applications to artificial intelligence systems.

An observation is defined as any physical interaction that results in a measurable, distinguishable change of state. From the first particle formation at the Big Bang to complex semantic processing in artificial intelligence systems, all information structures emerge from sequences of concrete observations. 2 Paolo Pignatelli Observational Influence Fields This document develops the complete mathematical formalism for observational influence fields and provides computational rules for their implementation through cellular automata. 2 Part I: Mathematical Formalism for Observational Influence Fields 2.1 Foundational Definitions Definition 2.1 (Observation Space). Let Ω be the space of all possible observations, where each observation O ∈ Ω is characterized by: O = (sbefore, einteraction, safter, t, x) where: • sbefore, safter ∈ S (state space) • einteraction ∈ E (interaction events) • t ∈ R+ (timestamp) • x ∈ Rn (spatial location) Definition 2.2 (Observational Influence Function). For an observation Oi at position xi and time ti, the influence function is: Ii(x, t) : Rn × R+ → R+ satisfying: 1. Locality: Ii(x, t) → 0 as |x − xi| → ∞ 2. Causality: Ii(x, t) = 0 for t < ti 3. Conservation: ∫ space ∫ time Ii(x, t) dx dt = Ei (finite energy) Definition 2.3 (Observational Influence Field). The total influence field at point (x, t) is: Φ(x, t) = ∑ i:ti≤t Ii(x, t) 2.2 Theoretical Framework Theorem 2.4 (Influence Field Dynamics). The observational influence field evolves according to: ∂Φ ∂t = D∇2Φ − λΦ + ∑ i δ(x − xi)δ(t − ti)Ei where: • D: diffusion coeﬀicient (influence spreading rate) • λ: decay constant (influence fade rate) • Ei: influence strength of observation Oi Proof. The equation combines three physical principles: 1. Diffusion: ∇2Φ (influence spreads spatially) 2. Decay: −λΦ (influence diminishes over time) 3 Paolo Pignatelli Observational Influence Fields 3. Sources: δ-functions (observations create influence) This is the standard form for a diffusion equation with sources and decay. Theorem 2.5 (Green’s Function Solution). The influence field has the explicit solution: Φ(x, t) = ∑ i EiG(x − xi, t − ti) where G(x, τ) is the Green’s function: G(x, τ) = (4πDτ)−n/2 exp ( − |x|2 4Dτ − λτ ) H(τ) and H(τ) is the Heaviside step function ensuring causality. Proof. Direct verification by substitution into the PDE. The Green’s function satisfies: ∂G ∂τ = D∇2G − λG + δ(x)δ(τ) with initial condition G(x, 0) = δ(x). Corollary 2.6 (Influence Kernel). The influence between observations Oi and Oj is: K(Oi, Oj) = Ii(xj, tj) = EiG(xj − xi, tj − ti) 2.3 Perturbability Formalism Definition 2.7 (Local Perturbability). The perturbability at point (x, t) is defined as: Π(x, t) = |∇Φ(x, t)| + α∂Φ ∂t where α weights temporal vs spatial sensitivity. Theorem 2.8 (Perturbability Evolution). The perturbability field satisfies: ∂Π ∂t = D∇2Π − λΠ + β|∇Φ|2 + ∑ i δ(x − xi)δ(t − ti)Pi where: • β: nonlinear coupling between influence and perturbability • Pi: perturbability injection from observation Oi Definition 2.9 (Mutual Perturbability). For two influence fields ΦA, ΦB, the mutual perturba- bility is: Πmutual(x, t) = |∇ΦA · ∇ΦB| exp ( −|∇ΠA − ∇ΠB| σ ) where σ is the gradient alignment scale. 4 Paolo Pignatelli Observational Influence Fields 2.4 Probability Measures Theorem 2.10 (Observational Probability Density). The probability density for a new observa- tion at (x, t) is: ρ(x, t) = Z−1Π(x, t) exp ( −S[x, t] ℏobs ) where: • Z: normalization constant • S[x, t]: action functional • ℏobs: observational quantum (related to ℏlang) Definition 2.11 (Action Functional). S[x, t] = ∫ t 0 [1 2m| ˙x|2 + Veff(x, τ) ] dτ where Veff(x, τ) = − log Φ(x, τ) is the effective potential. Theorem 2.12 (Path Integral Formulation). The probability amplitude for observational path γ : x(t0) → x(t1) is: A[γ] = ∫ Dx(t) exp (iS[x] ℏobs ) ∏ t Π(x(t), t)1/2 2.5 Distance and Metric Structure Definition 2.13 (Observational Distance). The distance between observations Oi, Oj is: dobs(Oi, Oj) = ∫ pathij 1 Π(x, t) ds where the integral is over the shortest path of highest perturbability. Theorem 2.14 (Metric Properties). The observational distance satisfies: 1. Positivity: dobs(Oi, Oj) ≥ 0 2. Symmetry: dobs(Oi, Oj) = dobs(Oj, Oi) (in equilibrium) 3. Triangle Inequality: dobs(Oi, Ok) ≤ dobs(Oi, Oj) + dobs(Oj, Ok) Definition 2.15 (Observational Metric Tensor). In the continuous limit: gµν(x, t) = Π(x, t)−1δµν + α∂µ∂ν log Π(x, t) 2.6 Energy and Conservation Laws Theorem 2.16 (Observational Energy Conservation). Total observational energy is conserved: d dt ∫ [1 2Π(∇Φ)2 + 1 2λΦ2 ] dx = 0 Definition 2.17 (Observational Stress-Energy Tensor). Tµν = Π∂µΦ∂νΦ − 1 2gµν [ Π(∇Φ)2 + λΦ2] Theorem 2.18 (Observational Field Equations). The influence field satisfies Einstein-like equa- tions: Rµν − 1 2Rgµν = κTµν where Rµν is the curvature of observational spacetime. 5 Paolo Pignatelli Observational Influence Fields 3 Part II: Computational Rules for Observation-Based Cellular Automata 3.1 Discrete Observational Lattice Definition 3.1 (Observation Lattice). Discretize space-time into cells Ci,j,k,t where each cell can contain at most one observation per time step. State Variables per Cell: Each cell Ci maintains: • Oi: current observation (if any) • Φi(t): local influence field value • Πi(t): local perturbability • historyi: recent observation sequence 3.2 Basic Update Rules Rule 1: Influence Propagation At each time step t → t + 1: Φi(t + 1) = (1 − λ∆t)Φi(t) + D · ∆t · ∑ j∈neighbors(i) Φj(t) − Φi(t) |j − i|2 + sourcei(t) (1) where sourcei(t) = Ei if an observation occurs at cell i at time t, else 0. Rule 2: Perturbability Update Πi(t + 1) = |∇Φi(t)| + αΦi(t) − Φi(t − 1) ∆t + β|∇Φi(t)|2 where ∇Φi is computed using finite differences from neighbors. Rule 3: Observation Triggering A new observation occurs in cell i if: Ptrigger = Πi(t) · g(local configuration) > thresholdi where g(local configuration) depends on neighboring observations. 3.3 Advanced Computational Rules Rule 4: Observation Type Selection When triggered, the observation type is selected probabilistically: P(observation type = k) ∝ exp ( − Ek kBTsemantic ) where Ek is the “semantic energy” of observation type k. Rule 5: Influence Injection When observation Oi occurs: Φi(t + 1) ← Φi(t + 1) + Ei (2) Πi(t + 1) ← Πi(t + 1) + Pi (3) ∀j ∈ neighbors(i) : influence flow i → j based on gradient (4) Rule 6: Memory Integration historyi(t + 1) = decay factor × historyi(t) + current observation (5) semantic depthi = ∫ historyi weighted by recency (6) 6 Paolo Pignatelli Observational Influence Fields 3.4 Semantic Thread Formation Rule 7: Thread Initiation A semantic thread starts when: correlation(Oi, Oj) > thread threshold ∧ temporal proximity(Oi, Oj) Rule 8: Thread Propagation Once a thread γ exists, its influence on cell i is: thread influencei = ∑ Ok∈γ K(Ok, positioni) × thread strength(γ) Rule 9: Thread Interaction When threads γA and γB intersect at cell i: Pmerge = mutual perturbability(γA, γB) × alignment factor 3.5 Convergence and Stability Rule 10: System Equilibrium The system reaches equilibrium when: |Φi(t + 1) − Φi(t)| < ϵΦ ∀i (7) |Πi(t + 1) − Πi(t)| < ϵΠ ∀i (8) Rule 11: Pattern Recognition Stable patterns emerge when: ∃ subset S of cells: correlation matrix(S) has dominant eigenvalue > threshold 3.6 Implementation Algorithm 3.7 Connection to Florence Conjecture The computational rules implement the Florence Conjecture as: Preconvergence(γA, γB) = ∑ Ci∈ΓA∩ΓB influenceA[Ci] × influenceB[Ci] normalization × alignment factor[Ci] This discrete formulation directly implements the continuous integral: Preconvergence(γA, γB) ∝ ∫ Ci∈ΓA∩ΓB (δFA(Ci) · δFB(Ci)) · exp(−|∇dA(Ci) − ∇dB(Ci)|) 4 Conclusions and Future Directions This mathematical framework establishes observations as the fundamental building blocks of semantic reality, providing both continuous field-theoretic descriptions and discrete computa- tional implementations.
