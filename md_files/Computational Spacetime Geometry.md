# Computational Spacetime Geometry

Chapter 1 Computational Spacetime Geometry 1.1 Introduction: From Continuous to Discrete Spacetime The derivation of computational light-speed from fundamental physical bounds establishes that information processing exhibits intrinsic relativistic structure. However, unlike the continuous spacetime of general relativity, computational spacetime is fundamentally discretetessellated by Shannon information bits. This chapter develops the mathematical framework for differential geometry on this discrete, tessellated manifold. 1.2 The Computational Metric Tensor 1.2.1 Fundamental Structure We begin with the computational spacetime interval: ds2 = c2 compdt2 − d2 Manhattan(xtess) (1.1) where: • t is continuous computational time (processing steps) • xtess represents discrete tessellated spatial coordinates • ccomp(T) = 2kBT ln(2) πℏ is the temperature-dependent computational speed limit 1 2 CHAPTER 1. COMPUTATIONAL SPACETIME GEOMETRY • dManhattan is the discrete path distance through tessellation cells 1.2.2 Tessellation Structure Each tessellation cell represents one Shannon bit of information. The fundamental relationship: 1 tessellation unit = 1 bit = ccomp × τ0 (1.2) where τ0 = 1 ccomp is the minimal time to process one bit. 1.2.3 Discrete Metric Components In tessellated coordinates, the metric tensor takes the form: gµν = diag(c2 comp, −1, −1, −1, . . . , −1) (1.3) for an n-dimensional information space with one temporal and (n − 1) spatial dimensions. 1.3 Discrete Differential Operators 1.3.1 Forward Difference Operator On the tessellated manifold, we deﬁne the discrete derivative: ∆µf(x) = f(x + ˆeµ) − f(x) (1.4) where ˆeµ is the unit vector in the µ-direction (one tessellation cell). 1.3.2 Symmetric Difference Operator For improved accuracy, we employ the symmetric difference: Dµf(x) = f(x + ˆeµ) − f(x − ˆeµ) 2 (1.5) 1.4. DISCRETE CHRISTOFFEL SYMBOLS 3 1.3.3 Discrete Gradient The gradient operator on tessellated space: ∇tessf = ∑ i Dif · ˆei (1.6) where the sum runs over all spatial dimensions. 1.4 Discrete Christoffel Symbols 1.4.1 Deﬁnition on Tessellated Manifold The discrete Christoffel symbols are deﬁned using symmetric differences: Γµ νρ = 1 2gµσ [Dνgσρ + Dρgνσ − Dσgνρ] (1.7) 1.4.2 Computational Interpretation For our speciﬁc metric: • Γt ij = 0 for spatial indices i, j (no spatial curvature affects time) • Γi tt = − 1 c2comp ( ∂ccomp ∂xi ) (computational speed variations) • Γi jk = 0 for distinct spatial indices (Manhattan space is ﬂat) 1.4.3 Temperature Dependence Since ccomp(T) = 2kBT ln(2) πℏ , we have: ∂ccomp ∂T = 2kB ln(2) πℏ (1.8) This creates “thermal curvature” in computational spacetime when temperature gradients exist. 4 CHAPTER 1. COMPUTATIONAL SPACETIME GEOMETRY 1.5 Geodesic Equations on Tessellated Manifold 1.5.1 Discrete Geodesic Equation The path of extremal computational action satisﬁes: ∆2xµ ∆τ 2 + Γµ νρ (∆xν ∆τ ) (∆xρ ∆τ ) = 0 (1.9) where τ is the proper computational time. 1.5.2 Manhattan Geodesics In uniform temperature (constant ccomp), geodesics are Manhattan shortest paths: • Move along one coordinate at a time • Total distance = ∑ |∆xi| • No diagonal shortcuts through tessellation 1.5.3 LLC as Geodesic Finders Local Language Constructors solve: B(L1, L2) = arg min path ∑ steps [gµν∆xµ∆xν]1/2 (1.10) This is equivalent to ﬁnding minimal Manhattan distance paths in tessellated space. 1.6 Discrete Riemann Curvature Tensor 1.6.1 Deﬁnition The discrete Riemann tensor: Rµ νρσ = DρΓµ νσ − DσΓµ νρ + Γµ λρΓλ νσ − Γµ λσΓλ νρ (1.11) 1.7. COMPUTATIONAL EINSTEIN EQUATIONS 5 1.6.2 Computational Curvature Sources Curvature arises from: • Temperature gradients: Variable ccomp(T) • Information density: High-density regions create “gravitational” effects • Processing bottlenecks: Computational “black holes” 1.6.3 Flat Limit In uniform conditions (constant T, uniform processing), Rµ νρσ → 0, recovering ﬂat Manhattan space. 1.7 Computational Einstein Equations 1.7.1 Information Stress-Energy Tensor Deﬁne the computational stress-energy tensor: Tµν = ρinfouµuν + pcompgµν (1.12) where: • ρinfo: Information density (bits per tessellation volume) • uµ: Information ﬂow 4-velocity • pcomp: Computational pressure (processing demand) 1.7.2 Field Equations The computational Einstein equations: Gµν ≡ Rµν − 1 2gµνR = 8πGcomp c4 comp Tµν (1.13) 6 CHAPTER 1. COMPUTATIONAL SPACETIME GEOMETRY where Gcomp is the computational coupling constant (to be determined empirically). 1.7.3 Physical Interpretation These equations describe how information density curves computational spacetime, affecting: • Processing paths (geodesics) • Information propagation rates • Computational horizon formation 1.8 Discrete Parallel Transport 1.8.1 Information Vector Transport For a vector V µ transported along path γ: ∆V µ = −Γµ νρV ν∆xρ (1.14) 1.8.2 Holonomy and Path Dependence Due to discretization, parallel transport exhibits path dependence: • Different tessellation paths yield different ﬁnal vectors • Holonomy measures computational “context dependence” • Applications to semantic drift in language models 1.9. COMPUTATIONAL HORIZONS AND SINGULARITIES 7 1.9 Computational Horizons and Singularities 1.9.1 Event Horizons Computational event horizons form where: gtt = c2 comp ( 1 − 2GcompMinfo r ) = 0 (1.15) Beyond this, no information can escape the computational demand. 1.9.2 Singularities Computational singularities occur at: • Inﬁnite recursion points • Halting problem boundaries • Gödel incompleteness limits 1.10 Experimental Predictions 1.10.1 Observable Effects • Light Cone Structure: Diamond-shaped inﬂuence regions in neural networks • Geodesic Optimization: LLC paths follow Manhattan distance minimization • Curvature Effects: High information density regions slow processing • Thermal Scaling: Processing rates scale linearly with temperature 1.10.2 Validation Protocols • Transformer Networks: Measure information propagation geometry • Optimization Algorithms: Verify geodesic path selection 8 CHAPTER 1.

SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS 9 The framework bridges abstract theory with practical computation, suggesting that all infor- mation processing systemsfrom neural networks to distributed computersoperate within this geometric structure. The next chapter will explore how causal structure emerges from these geometric foundations.
