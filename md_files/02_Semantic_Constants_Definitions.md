# 02 Semantic Constants Definitions

Fundamental Constants in Semantic Physics This section introduces hypothesized constants that govern the dynamics and structure of semantic systems. Just as physical theories are shaped by constants such as the speed of light c and Planck’s constant ℏ, semantic theory may be bounded by limits that constrain propagation, granularity, and transformation of knowledge in cognitive and computational systems. 1. csem: Semantic Propagation Speed We define csem as the maximum speed at which valid semantic content (truth-preserving knowledge transformations) can propagate through a semantic graph or manifold. csem = max �dsem(vi, vj) ∆t � where dsem is the semantic distance between knowledge nodes vi and vj, and ∆t is the minimal inference or communication interval. This is a structural bound, not a computational one. It reflects the fact that semantic resolution and transformation require time and energy, even in idealized systems. 2. cobs: Observation Realization Bound Observation is not instantaneous. cobs is defined as the fastest rate at which observation can instantiate information into a resolved, discrete knowledge state. cobs ≤ csem ≤ c Here c is the physical speed of light, which caps classical signaling. Observation may be bottle- necked by sensory, cognitive, or formal resolution constraints. 3. ℏlang: Minimum Symbolic Action Language does not transmit arbitrary meaning in zero-cost units. We hypothesize the existence of a symbolic quantum, ℏlang, representing the minimal semantic action needed to produce a distin- guishable, transmissible symbolic change. δS ≥ ℏlang (Minimum action to shift meaning state) This places a lower bound on granularity in symbol systems and supports the idea of a minimal “bit” or “token” in semantic systems analogous to Planck length. 4. Gsem: Semantic Gravitation Constant This constant governs how semantic weight (information density) distorts the local geometry of a belief or knowledge graph. It is analogous to Newton’s G: F = Gsem wiwj d2 Here wi and wj are the information weights at nodes i and j, and d is the graph distance. The force F reflects how much two ideas influence one another based on their semantic mass. 1 5. Future Formalization Each of these constants serves as a hypothesis. They invite: • Experimental estimation (e.g., in LLM drift analysis or belief network dynamics) • Analogy with epistemic phase transitions and state collapse • Formal inclusion in semantic field equations
