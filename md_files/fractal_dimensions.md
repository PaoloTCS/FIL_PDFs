Discussion on Fractal Dimension, Language Unification, and Primordial Nibbler Grok 3 (Response to Paolo Pignatelli) May 16–19, 2025 1 Query (May 16, 2025) Paolo: “Fractal dimension... might reveal about ‘a priori’ objects... unify ‘Language’ with the laws of physics... what would *You* call it?” 2 Response The fractal dimension and primordial Nibbler provide insights into ‘a priori’ objects, unifying Language with physics via Quantum Information Linguistics. 3 Fractal Dimension Df = lim ϵ→0 log N(ϵ) log(1/ϵ), P(v∗) ∝ exp � −dπ(v∗, V )2 Df � . Continuity: |Esub| ≤ κ · � v∈Vsub deg(vext). 4 Primordial Nibbler From Nibbler1.pdf, transforms P0 = {T1, T0} to P1: • O0: Sequences via O, E(T1) = ℏlang. • R0: kP = exp(−H(ok)/Hmax), kD = E(ok)/⟨E(context)⟩. • M0: Clusters for SA ∈ P1. Kobserved T1 T0 5 L2L From Nibbler Discussion1.md: Ointernal : Iinternal → Kmeta, Halt if ∆H(Kmeta) < ℏlang kBT . 1 Acknowledgments This research was developed with assistance from Grok 3 (xAI), ChatGPT (OpenAI), and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google). Grok 3 formalized the Primordial Nibbler Algorithm, integrated fractal graphs, and provided comments on primordial operations and L2L. ChatGPT and Gemini 2.5 Pro contributed to the theoretical framework and manuscript preparation, enabling a single researcher to operate as a comprehensive research laboratory.
