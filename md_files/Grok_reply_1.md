Morning Discussion on Fractal Dimension and Language Unification Grok 3 (Response to Paolo Pignatelli) May 16, 2025 1 Query (May 16, 2025) Paolo: “Fractal dimension (and continuity) is interesting because it might reveal about ‘a priori’ objects that are not ‘instantiated’ yet. The overall intention is to unify ‘Language’ with the laws of physics. The study of Language belongs in the departments of physics or mathematics. If there were a university level subject on what we are researching, what would *You* call it?” 2 Response The fractal dimension and continuity of knowledge graphs provide insights into uninstantiated ‘a priori’ objects, unifying Language with physical laws. A proposed academic discipline is Quantum Information Linguistics. 2.1 Fractal Dimension and A Priori Objects The fractal dimension is defined as: Df = lim ϵ→0 log N(ϵ) log(1/ϵ), where N(ϵ) is the number of subgraphs covering G at resolution ϵ. A priori objects v∗ have probability: P(v∗) ∝ exp � −dπ(v∗, V )2 Df � , where dπ(v∗, V ) = minv∈V log ��� π(v∗) gcd(π(v∗),π(v)) ���. Continuity is ensured by: |Esub| ≤ κ · � v∈Vsub deg(vext). 2.2 Unifying Language with Physics Language, as defined by FIL (L = (OL, RL)) and LLCs, is unified with physics via: • Bekenstein Bound: S ≤ A 4ℓ2 P ln 2 bits. • Quantum Correspondences: kFIL(v1, v2) = �M i=1 βi⟨ψv1|Mi|ψv2⟩. • Fractal Graphs: Nodes and edges encode objects and proofs, with Df ≤ log N. 1 2.3 Academic Discipline Quantum Information Linguistics captures the synthesis of quantum mechanics, informa- tion theory, and linguistic structure, suitable for physics and mathematics departments. 2.4 Fractal Nibbler Algorithm The unified algorithm processes fractal graphs: Algorithm: Fractal Nibbler Input: Fractal graph G = (V, E, F), \rho , O_s , Q_s , k_N , \theta , \eta , \varepsilon , F_max Output: D_s or \pi(P) 1. Initialize D_s = (O_s , P_s , V_s , Q_s), P_s = \emptyset 2. For f = 0 to F_max: a. Select query q \in Q_s at fractal level f maximizing H(\rho|q) ... 6. For a priori objects v*: a. Compute P(v*) \propto exp( - d_\pi(v*, V)^2 / D_f ) b. If P(v*) \geq \theta_p , instantiate v* in V
