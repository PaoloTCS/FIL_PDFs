Discussion on Nibbler Algorithm and Fractal Knowledge Graphs Paolo Pignatelli and Grok 3 May 15–16, 2025 1 Introduction This document compiles the discussion between Paolo Pignatelli and Grok 3 on the Nibbler Al- gorithm, fractal knowledge graphs, and their unification with physical laws, based on main9.pdf and the .tex file. The conversation spans queries and responses from May 15–16, 2025. 2 Query: Nibbler Algorithm (May 15, 2025) Paolo: “Looking at main9.pdf, please tell me what you know about Nibbler.” Grok 3 Response: The Nibbler Algorithm is a key component of the Unified Framework for Fundamental Interaction and Communication (main9.pdf, Section 8). It facilitates discovery and pattern recognition through a hierarchical observation framework, operating within the Fundamental Interaction Language (FIL) and Local Language Constructors (LLC). 2.1 Key Details • Discovery State (Definition 8.1): Ds = (Os, Ps, Vs), where Os is observations, Ps is proofs, and Vs is the verification operator. • Pattern Hierarchy (Definition 8.4): Hp = {(Pi, Ri, Mi)}n i=1, with recognition operator Ri and meta-pattern extractor Mi. • Nibbler Kernel (Definition 8.6): kN(x, y) = αkD(x, y) + (1 − α)kP (x, y). 3 Query: Unifying Greedy Nibbler (May 15, 2025) Paolo: “Tomorrow, let’s go over Nibbler again and how we can refine it... please help me unify Greedy Nibbler (in the .tex file) with main body.” Grok 3 Response: The Greedy Nibbler (.tex, Section 3) selects queries in V = FN 2 /⟨1⟩ to identify micro-states, while the Nibbler Algorithm (main9.pdf) uses hierarchical pattern recognition. A unified algorithm was proposed: Algorithm: Unified Nibbler Input: State space S (|S|=N), prior \rho, O_s, Q_s, k_N, \theta, \eta, \ varepsilon Output: D_s or \pi(P) 1. Initialize D_s = (O_s, P_s, V_s, Q_s), P_s = \emptyset 2. While |O_s| < N and not converged: a. Select query q \in Q_s maximizing H(\rho|q) b. Update O_s \leftarrow O_s \cup \{o\} c. Compute P_i = \{p \in O_s | k_N(p, D_s) \geq \theta\} ... 1 4 Query: Fractal Graphs and Language Unification (May 15, 2025) Paolo: “Let’s take a portion of a graph (an island portion) which represents the instantiation of an ‘idea’... The same basic graph explain that these different levels is like a fractal... what the ‘ultimate’ fractal/(directed) graph object might look like?” Grok 3 Response: A fractal knowledge graph G = (V, E, F) was proposed, with: • Resolution: R(Gsub) = |Vsub| |Esub| · log |Osub|. • Density: ρ(Gsub) = |{e∈Esub:e valid}| |Vsub|·|Esub| . • Fractal level: F(Gsub) = maxv∈Vsub Γ(v). The smallest edge length is tied to proof distance dproof(e) = log ��� π(v1) π(v2) ���. 5 Query: Fractal Dimension and Academic Discipline (May 16, 2025) Paolo: “Fractal dimension (and continuity) is interesting because it might reveal about ‘a priori’ objects... The overall intention is to unify ‘Language’ with the laws of physics... If there were a university level subject, what would *You* call it?” Grok 3 Response: The fractal dimension Df = limϵ→0 log N(ϵ) log(1/ϵ) reveals potential ‘a priori’ objects with probability P(v∗) ∝ exp � − dπ(v∗,V )2 Df � . Language is unified with physics via the Bekenstein bound, quantum correspondences, and fractal graphs. The proposed discipline name is Quantum Information Linguistics. 5.1 Fractal Nibbler Algorithm Algorithm: Fractal Nibbler Input: Fractal graph G = (V, E, F), \rho, O_s, Q_s, k_N, \theta, \eta, \ varepsilon , F_max Output: D_s or \pi(P) 1. Initialize D_s = (O_s, P_s, V_s, Q_s), P_s = \emptyset 2. For f = 0 to F_max: a. Select query q \in Q_s at fractal level f maximizing H(\rho|q) ... 6. For `a priori' objects v*: a. Compute P(v*) \propto exp( - d_\pi(v*, V)^2 / D_f ) b. If P(v*) \geq \theta_p , instantiate v* in V
