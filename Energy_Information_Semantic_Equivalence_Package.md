# Energy–Information Equivalence & Interference-Based Semantic Graph Transmission

## Part A: Core Energy–Information Equivalence

### 1. Extended Maxwell–Semantic Analogy Table (Dual-Mode)
| Electrical Concept | Symbol | Physics Definition | Semantic Analogy | Semantic Physics Definition |
|--------------------|--------|--------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| Electric Potential | V | Work per unit charge | Semantic Potential (V_s) | Meaning capacity difference |
| Electric Field | E | Force per unit charge | Semantic Field (S) | Gradient of semantic potential |
| Charge Density | ρ | Charge per unit volume | Information Density (ρ_s) | Stored semantic content |
| Current Density | J | Charge flow per area/time | Meaning Flux (J_s) | Flow of meaning quanta |
| Conductivity | σ | Proportionality E↔J | Semantic Conductivity (σ_s) | Ease of meaning transfer |
| Resistance | R | Opposition to current | Semantic Resistance (R_s) | Opposition to meaning flow |
| Capacitance | C | Charge/voltage | Semantic Capacitance (C_s) | Meaning quanta per potential |
| Inductance | L | Opposition to Δcurrent | Semantic Inductance (L_s) | Inertia of meaning flow changes |
| Maxwell Equations | — | EM field laws | Semantic Field Equations | Governing semantic field laws |
| Poynting Vector | S=E×H | Energy flow vector | Semantic Poynting Vector (P_s) | Meaning energy flow per area |

### 2. Semantic Maxwell’s Equations (Continuous Field Form)
- **Gauss’s Law (Semantic)**: ∇·S = ρ_s / ε_s  
- **Gauss’s Law for “Magnetic Meaning”**: ∇·B_s = 0  
- **Faraday’s Law (Semantic)**: ∇×S = -∂B_s/∂t  
- **Ampère–Maxwell (Semantic)**: ∇×B_s = μ_s J_s + μ_s ε_s ∂S/∂t  

### 3. Discrete Graph Equivalents
- **Node potential** ↔ Semantic potential V_s(i)  
- **Edge weight** ↔ Conductivity σ_s(ij)  
- **Prime encoder node** ↔ Semantic capacitor C_s  
- **Transformer node** ↔ Potential step-up/down operation

### 4. Equivalence Principle Statement
Energy and information are physically interchangeable manifestations of the same underlying field dynamics; transmission, storage, and transformation are governed by a single set of Maxwell–Semantic equations with domain-specific constants.

## Part C: Wave/Interference Transmission Layer

### 7. Interference-Based Semantic Graph Transmission
- Nodes assigned carrier frequencies (prime-coded)  
- Edges as modulation patterns (AM, FM, PM)  
- Superposition → interference envelope in space-time  
- Receiver performs Fourier/wavelet decomposition → reconstructs graph topology

### 8. Diagram of Interference Encoding

4. Spectrum analysis → original graph]

### 9. LLM Integration Notes
- Store graphs as interference patterns internally  
- Retrieval = spectral projection  
- Enables analog, massively parallel graph query
